  Load this skill whenever a run of the KaxaNuk Backtest Engine is being set up, executed, debugged
  or read. Use it when the user asks to install `kaxanuk-backtest-engine`, initialise its project
  files, shape a portfolio weight file or market-data files for it, fill in
  `backtest_engine_parameters.xlsx`, call `PyArrowBacktester` or the `kaxanuk.backtest_engine` CLI,
  attach a commission or slippage model, add a benchmark, or read the returned tables and the Excel
  report (CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, VaR, CVaR, drawdown, annual returns). It covers the two inputs the
  engine reads and the layouts it detects, the licence and its environment variable, and how the
  engine is called from a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository. It does NOT cover the research process or
  the notebook contract (use `experiment-lifecycle`), running the attribution library (use
  `attribution-analysis-runs`), reading attribution output (use `alpha-decomposition`), or authoring
  Data Curator `c_*` columns (use `data-curator-custom-calculations`).

# Running the KaxaNuk Backtest Engine

Step 5 of the KaxaNuk Investment Lab: the rules are run over history, with costs and no look-ahead,
and a track record comes back. The engine is **licensed** and closed-source — it is not on public
PyPI, and it is deliberately absent from the KaxaNuk Strategy Template's `pyproject.toml` so its
index URL and key never enter version control.

**Every performance figure in a KaxaNuk strategy comes from this engine.** There is deliberately no
second, lighter simulator: one that disagreed would only let a reader pick the number they
preferred.

## 1. Install it without leaking the key

Install from the index URL in the licence welcome email, from the repository root and through `uv`,
so it lands in the repository's `.venv` rather than wherever the first `pip` on the path points:

```bash
uv pip install kaxanuk-backtest-engine --extra-index-url https://license:{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}@{SERVER}/simple/
```

Inside a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository that is all: the configuration is built in code, in
`Experiments/backtest_engine.py` (section 7; the worked example's `build_configuration` shows how),
and nothing is initialised at the root. Outside one, lay down the project files once:

```bash
uv run python -m kaxanuk.backtest_engine init excel
```

Three rules, and the first is not negotiable:

- **Never print, echo or commit the key or the index URL** — not into a notebook output, a log line,
  a shell history or a dependency file. The command above carries a credential: run it, do not paste
  it back. An exposed key is rotated, not edited out.
- **Never add the engine to a repository's dependency file.** It is installed by hand, per machine,
  by whoever holds the licence.
- **Python 3.12 or 3.13**, per the documentation. That ceiling is the engine's, and it is why a
  KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository pins `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"` and installs 3.13:
  the Data Curator allows up to 3.14 and the engine does not, so 3.13 is the version that satisfies
  both. A project pinned above the range needs a separate interpreter for the engine — report the
  mismatch rather than quietly pinning around it.

The licence key lives in `Config/.env` as **`KNBE_API_KEY_KAXANUK`**. That is the name KaxaNuk uses,
and it is what a repository created from the KaxaNuk Strategy Template ships in
`Config/.env.template`. The engine's published quick start still shows an older
`KNPC_API_KEY_KAXANUK`; treat that spelling as stale. **Never print the value of either.**

**Keep it installed.** The licensed package is deliberately absent from `pyproject.toml` and the
lockfile, and `uv sync` is *exact* by default: it removes every package the lockfile does not name.
Probed on 2026-09-09 in a strategy repository — a plain `uv run …` keeps a hand-installed package,
`uv sync --inexact` keeps it, a bare `uv sync` removes it. So, once the engine is installed, never
run a bare `uv sync` in that repository again; after a relock use `uv sync --inexact` (with the
repository's groups), run everything else through `uv run`, and check `uv pip list | grep -i
kaxanuk` before any engine run. If the engine has vanished, this is why, and the install command
above is the fix.

## 2. Guard the import, always

A clone without a licence must still run everything else. Any module or cell that imports the engine
reports what is missing and skips, rather than raising:

```python
import importlib.util

ENGINE_INSTALLED = importlib.util.find_spec("kaxanuk.backtest_engine") is not None
```

Check `ENGINE_INSTALLED` before the call, and import `kaxanuk.backtest_engine` only inside that
branch, as the worked example's `Experiments/backtest_engine.py` does; where it is `False`, say
plainly that step 5 was skipped for want of the licensed engine. A `try` around `from kaxanuk…
import …` does the same job but fails Bloom Code (BLOOM003). **A pipeline that dies at an optional
import is a pipeline nobody can read.**

## 3. The two inputs

**The portfolio file — what to hold, and when.** Two layouts, detected automatically:

| Layout | First column | The rest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Horizontal | `Ticker` | one column per rebalancing date |
| Vertical | `date` | one column per ticker |

**The market-data files — one per security**, named `{TICKER}.csv` or `{TICKER}.parquet`. Each needs
a date column and at least three price columns. Which column plays which role is declared in the
configuration rather than inferred from its name, so a provider's naming does not have to be bent to
suit the engine.

Two consequences, and both are ways a backtest lies:

- **Commission is charged on the unadjusted price**, so the file the engine costs against has to
  carry the price actually paid, not a back-adjusted series.
- **A security missing from the market data on a rebalance date cannot be filled.** Reconcile the
  portfolio file's tickers against the market-data directory *before* running, and report the
  difference by name. A run that quietly holds fewer names than the weights say still summarises
  cleanly, and that is the failure nobody catches.

## 4. Configure it

`Config/backtest_engine_parameters.xlsx` holds the simulation parameters and the column-role
mapping. The same configuration can be supplied programmatically as a dict or YAML, which is what a
sweep should use — **a sweep that edits a workbook between runs is a sweep nobody will reproduce.**

In code, `main()` and `PyArrowBacktester` take a `kaxanuk.backtest_engine.entities.Configuration`.
The fields the worked example sets, the three price roles among them, and the two CSV input
handlers it passes are listed in `references/api.md`.

## 5. Run it

The CLI, from the project root, outside a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository — inside one the
engine is called in code (section 7):

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `uv run python -m kaxanuk.backtest_engine autorun` | installs missing project files on the first run, then executes the entry script |
| `uv run python -m kaxanuk.backtest_engine init excel` | lays down the configuration format and an entry script |
| `uv run python -m kaxanuk.backtest_engine run [PATHS]` | executes the given entry scripts or directories |
| `uv run python -m kaxanuk.backtest_engine update excel` | refreshes a template after an engine upgrade (also `update entry_script`) |

Or in code — `PyArrowBacktester`, built one of two ways and run one of two ways:

```python
backtester = PyArrowBacktester.create_from_configuration(
    configuration=configuration,
    input_handlers=[csv_input],
    portfolio_handlers=[csv_portfolio_input_handler],
    commission_model=commission_model,
)
results = backtester.run_with_benchmark()
```

`create_from_pipeline_result` is the same construction when the data pipeline has already run;
`run()` is `run_with_benchmark()` without the comparison arm. Full signatures, the properties an
instance exposes, and where each came from are in `references/api.md`.

**Attach the real cost model.** On a high-turnover book the difference between a flat cost
assumption and real per-share commission can be a third of the edge, so results are accepted **net,
or not at all**. `commission_model` and `slippage_model` are constructor arguments precisely so this
is a decision somebody makes rather than a default nobody read.

## 6. Read what comes back

`run()` returns a `BacktestResultDict`, and the `main()` entry point wraps it in a `BacktestResult`
with `success`, `error` and `data`. Tables arrive as PyArrow or pandas; the Excel report carries
CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, alpha, VaR, CVaR, maximum drawdown, annual returns, drawdown analysis and
portfolio weights. `references/api.md` lists the keys of `data`, verified on 0.66.0.

**`Daily_Weights` is the book as the engine actually held it**, one row per trading day, its columns
the holdings plus the benchmark and `CASH_RESERVE`. That is the drifted daily series **step 6
reads** — the attribution library rejects a file that only carries the rebalance dates — so it is
written out beside the other results rather than recomputed later from the weight file.

The `metrics` module is public, so a figure quoted in a document can be recomputed from the returned
series rather than copied out of a cell: `sharpe_ratio`, `sortino_ratio`, `annualize_rets`,
`annualize_vol`, `var_historic`, `var_gaussian`, `cvar_historic`, `drawdown`, `tracking_error`,
`information_ratio` and `compute_portfolio_statistics` among them — all listed in
`references/api.md`.

**Read the run before believing it.** A truncated run — one that stopped valuing the book partway —
still produces a clean-looking summary over the stub. Check the last valued date against the window
that was asked for, and when they differ the variant is excluded **by name, with its reason**, never
quietly dropped.

**What a truncated run looks like, reproduced on 0.66.0.** A book whose weights sum to exactly 1.0
run with `cash_reserve_percentage = 0` cannot pay commission at a rebalance. The engine prints one
line — `Cash error on <date> with $-340.92` — stops valuing there, and returns:

| | Truncated | Complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` / `error` | `True` / `None` | `True` / `None` |
| days in `Register_df` | 522 | 1305 |
| CAGR | 23.6% | 14.2% |
| a key naming the stub | none | — |

Both runs wrote an Excel report, and the shorter one annualised over its stub, so its CAGR is the
higher of the two. **The check that catches it:** `data["end_date"]` and `data["years"]` describe
the window the engine *valued*, not the one the configuration asked for — compare them with the
configured dates before reading a single metric. **The cure is `cash_reserve_percentage`**, a
fraction: in a Strategy Template repository the weight file always sums to one (section 7), so the
reserve is the only cash that pays commission. `liquid-golden-cross` needed `0.02`; its long window
still truncated, in 2003 at 0.5% and in 2009 at 1%.

Configuration guards worth knowing before a first run: `commission_cents` is rejected outside
`[0.00, 0.10]`, and the engine checks on every rebalancing date that each position it touches has a
price and that no position outlives its price series.

**`commission_cents` is not cents per share, measured on 0.66.0.** The worked example froze `0.1`
in its blueprint as "0.1 cents per share", and the engine charged about $0.083 a share for it,
roughly twenty times a retail rate; its realistic variant uses `0.005`. Before a figure is frozen
in a blueprint, run it once and compare `Total_commissions` with the shares traded in `orders_df`.

## 7. Inside a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository

The engine is not called from a notebook directly. `Experiments/backtest_engine.py` is the seam, and
it owns four things: writing the weight file the engine reads, running the engine, reading the
results back, and aligning variants onto one window so they can be compared. Everything specific to
a strategy stays in that strategy's notebook.

- `Experiments/Experiment_N/Portfolio/portfolio_weights.csv` — the book, in the shape section 3
  describes.
- `Experiments/Experiment_N/Backtest/` — where results land, and **nothing in it is committed**: no
  workbooks, no charts. The numbers reach `FINDINGS_N.md`, and `RESULTS.md` is compiled from those.
- Target weights, what the rule returns, sum to **at most** one; the weight file sums to
  **exactly** one. It has no cash row, so `backtest_engine.py` writes the residual as a weight in
  the cash proxy (`write_weight_file` and `CASH_IDENTIFIER` in the worked example): going to cash
  buys a real, priced instrument and pays commission.
