# Input columns

Every parameter of a `c_*` function must name a column the Curator can resolve. The prefix before
the first underscore selects the data block, as the documentation's Data Tag Homogenization page
maps them; the rest of the name is the field within it.

| Prefix | Data block |
|---|---|
| `m_`   | Market data, daily: unadjusted, split-adjusted and dividend-and-split-adjusted |
| `f_`   | Fundamental data common to the statements: the filing and its fiscal period |
| `fbs_` | Balance sheet |
| `fcf_` | Cash flow |
| `fis_` | Income statement |
| `d_`   | Dividends |
| `s_`   | Splits |
| `c_`   | Calculations: the built-ins on the Features page and the project's own `c_*` functions, which may depend on each other |

Plus one non-column parameter: **`configuration`**, which receives the `Configuration`, as the
documentation's page for `c_last_twelve_months_net_income` shows with its `period`.

## Find the valid names in the documentation, do not guess them

The documentation lists them. Read the lists rather than memory, and never the installed package:

- **Input tags** — `m_*`, `f_*`, `fbs_*`, `fcf_*`, `fis_*`, `d_*`, `s_*` — on the page of the data
  provider the run uses, which lists every Data Curator tag it supports beside the provider's own
  name for it:
  <https://kaxanuk-data-curator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data_providers/financial_modeling_prep.html>
  for FMP, <https://kaxanuk-data-curator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data_providers/lseg_workspace.html>
  for LSEG. The prefixes are on
  <https://kaxanuk-data-curator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data_providers/data_tag_homogenization.html>.
  A tag missing from the provider's page is one that provider does not supply: FMP's page has no
  unadjusted `m_vwap`, which the worked example rebuilds as `c_vwap` because FMP leaves it empty.
- **Built-in calculations** — every `c_*` the library ships — on the Features page,
  <https://kaxanuk-data-curator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference/features.html>, one page per
  function with the columns it reads, what it returns and its formula. Add the project's own
  custom modules.

The `stable` pages follow the newest release, 0.50.0 when this skill was checked; on another build,
read the release notes there before trusting a list.

## Market data columns

The market data tags are `m_date` and `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `vwap`, each in
three variants: unadjusted, `_split_adjusted` and `_dividend_and_split_adjusted` (the changelog,
0.39, added the adjusted ones). So `m_close`, `m_close_split_adjusted` and
`m_close_dividend_and_split_adjusted` are three different columns. A provider supplies only some of
them: FMP's page lists no unadjusted `m_vwap` and no `m_vwap_dividend_and_split_adjusted`, and
LSEG's lists the unadjusted prices, volume and VWAP, and split-adjusted open, high, low and close.

Which one to use is a modelling decision, not a detail:

- `_dividend_and_split_adjusted` for returns and anything that must be comparable through time.
- `_split_adjusted` for price levels and for anything multiplied by a share count, such as market
  cap, as the built-in `c_market_cap` does (the changelog, 0.40.2).
- unadjusted for the price actually traded on the day.

**Volume can arrive split twice.** A provider's unadjusted `m_volume` before a split may already be
post-split, and the split adjustment counts it again: check it as `universe-point-in-time` says.

`m_date` holds the trading date. Always select it: the worked example's runs did, and the
documentation does not say it is added for you.

## Dividend and split columns

These blocks report discrete events. The provider pages list their tags: `d_declaration_date`,
`d_ex_dividend_date`, `d_record_date`, `d_payment_date`, `d_dividend` and
`d_dividend_split_adjusted` for dividends; `s_split_date`, `s_numerator` and `s_denominator` for
splits. The names of the columns a run writes from them — whether a date and an amount are joined
into one name — are on no documentation page and in no recorded run: they come from a run. Before
a calculation depends on one, select it in a short run in a scratch copy, read the output's header,
and record what it was.

Dividends and splits are data blocks of their own, each mapped to a provider in
`data_block_providers` (the changelog, 0.50.0).

## Fundamental columns

Fundamental values are reported per filing. On the daily rows, each filing's values repeat: the
Helpers page says of `indexed_rolling_window_operation` that period data carries "the same key and
thus the same data" on every row, which is why the last-twelve-months built-ins roll over filings,
not over days. Values also depend on the configured `period` (`annual` or `quarterly`): the page for
`c_last_twelve_months_net_income` sums four quarters for quarterly and returns the period's own
value for annual.

`f_*` carries the filing metadata that makes period-aware maths possible, notably `f_fiscal_year`
and `f_fiscal_period`, which `c_last_twelve_months_net_income` takes beside `fis_net_income`, as its
page shows. FMP's page lists both; LSEG's lists neither.

## Failure modes

- A parameter that names no column stops the run with an error naming it; the changelog (0.12)
  improved the errors for a missing custom calculation and for circular dependencies.
- A column name is a documented tag — one of the prefixes above, as Data Tag Homogenization and the
  provider pages list them — or a `c_*` name in snake case. Anything else is not a column.
