  Load this skill whenever a book is sized in a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository — step 4, the rule
  cell and `Experiments/portfolio_construction.py` — or the KaxaNuk Portfolio Construction library is
  installed, configured, called or debugged. Use it when the user asks to pick or compare a sizing
  method (equal weight, inverse volatility, risk parity, HRP, mean-variance, the KN Index), call
  `build_allocator` or `run_pipeline`, build point-in-time eligibility, lag a signal, choose
  rebalance dates, add a weight cap or a minimum holding count, express cash as a position, or write
  the weight file the Backtest Engine reads. It covers installing the library, the per-date weigher
  and its one causal cut, the traps that make a plausible book wrong, and the invariants every rule
  must pass. It does NOT cover pricing the book (use `backtest-engine-runs`), reading what sizing
  earned (use `alpha-decomposition`), or the documents around the experiment (use
  `experiment-lifecycle`).

# Portfolio construction — the library inside one signature, and one cut

**In plain words:** how much of what, and how often you change your mind. **It produces** the
`REBALANCE_DATES x securities` target weights a rule hands to the diagnostics and the weight file.
**It prevents** a good signal in a portfolio nobody could hold — and a weighting difference that
reads as a signal difference because each notebook invented its own sizing.

Written against **KaxaNuk Portfolio Construction 1.28.0**. That build is the frontmatter's
`library_version`: compare it with the installed build `uv pip list` shows, and on a newer minor or
major version treat every trap here as unproven until it is checked again. The library keeps three
questions apart — *who plays* (selection), *how much* (sizing), *when* (timing) — and deliberately
leaves a fourth to its caller: *what was known on the day*. That fourth question is most of this
skill.

## 1. Install it, and keep it installed

The library is **proprietary**: not on public PyPI, its repository `KaxaNuk/Portfolio-Construction`
private, and no licence key or environment variable of its own. Whoever has access installs it by
hand, per machine, from a clone kept **beside** the strategy — never inside it:

```bash
uv pip install -e "<path to the Portfolio-Construction clone>[solver,clustering]"
```

- **Distribution and import `kaxanuk.portfolio_construction`; Python 3.12 or 3.13** — the Backtest
  Engine's ceiling too, so a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository needs nothing new.
- **The extras decide which methods exist.** `solver` (cvxpy) for constrained mean-variance, CVaR
  and CDaR; `clustering` (scipy) for HRP, HERC and NCO; `plots` (matplotlib) for figures and the PDF
  report; `calendars` (QuantLib, whatever the README says) for the exchange-calendar rebalancers. A
  missing extra fails differently per method: HRP and the solver methods when they are built, HERC
  and NCO only when they allocate, the calendar rebalancers with a bare `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- **`init excel` needs the editable install.** From a wheel it creates `Config/`, `Input/` and
  `Output/`, then fails to find its templates, and the leftover `Config/` blocks the retry. A
  research notebook does not need those files at all: configure in code.
- **Never add it to a strategy's `pyproject.toml`.** A clone without access must still resolve. And
  as with the licensed engines, `uv sync` is exact and removes a hand-installed package: after a
  relock use `uv sync --inexact`, and run everything else through `uv run`.

## 2. Guard the import — step 4 still runs without it

```python
import importlib.util

LIBRARY_INSTALLED = importlib.util.find_spec("kaxanuk.portfolio_construction") is not None
```

A clone without the library still builds a book: equal weight needs nothing but the eligible set.
**A method that needs the library, asked for without it, stops the run with a `ModuleNotFoundError`
that names it — never quietly replaced by equal weight**, because a book sized another way is
another experiment.

## 3. The three stages, and the registry

| Stage | Question | The pieces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selection | who plays | a `Signal` per date — True, False or null per security — and a `BinaryMatrix` across dates; `LiquidityFilter`, `BinaryFilter`, `ColumnMembershipFilter`, `CompositeUniverseFilter`, `UniverseCreator` |
| Sizing | how much | fourteen methods behind one factory, `build_allocator(*, name, config=None, returns=None)` |
| Timing | when | `CalendarRebalancer`, `FixedDateRebalancer`, `TimeSignalRebalancer`, and the QuantLib calendars |

**Null is not zero.** Selection is tri-state, and missing data becomes True or False only through
`MissingDataPolicy` — `EXCLUDE` by default, which for a returns history means listwise deletion: a
date with a gap in any eligible security is dropped for all of them. **The library dies loud**: one
pinned solver, `optimal_inaccurate` is an error, an infeasible mandate names the constraint that
cannot be met. Read an error before working around it.

**Ask the registry before choosing a method.** `describe("hrp")` prints what a method needs and what
it honours; `requirements_for("hrp")` returns the same as data.

| What the method needs | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| nothing but the eligible set | `equal_weight` |
| a column in the snapshot | `feature_weighting` (one numeric feature), `kn_index` (market cap and two traded-value windows) |
| a returns history | `inverse_volatility`, `risk_parity`, `max_diversification`, `mean_variance`, `black_litterman` (plus market cap); `hrp`, `herc`, `nco` with `clustering`; `constrained_mean_variance`, `cvar`, `cdar` with `solver` |

Every method's configuration, required fields, bounds and short-selling policy are in
`references/api.md`.

## 4. The contract: one signature, one cut

In a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository the library is called from **inside** the step-4 shared
module, `Experiments/portfolio_construction.py`, never around it. Every method goes through one
**weigher**, `weigh` in the worked example's module:

```python
weigh(
    selected: tuple[str, ...],              # what may be held on this rebalance date
    history: pandas.DataFrame,              # daily returns, ending STRICTLY BEFORE that date
    method: str,                            # "equal_weight", or a name in the registry
    maximum_weight: float | None,           # the cap; None switches it off
) -> pandas.Series                          # weights, non-negative, summing to at most 1.0
```

Equal weight, inverse volatility, HRP or any other method whose configuration has no required
field is one `method` string, so swapping one for another is one line in the rule cell and nothing
else in the notebook moves — which is what makes two experiments comparable rather than merely
adjacent. `weigh` builds each method with its default configuration and always hands it the
history, so the library refuses the rest: `mean_variance`, `constrained_mean_variance` and
`black_litterman` need a configuration passed, and `feature_weighting` and `kn_index` take no
history and read their columns from the snapshot. Such a method needs a weigher of its own, of the
same shape.

**The cut is the module's, made once.** `build_weights` hands `weigh` the rows dated strictly
before the rebalance date; `.loc[:date]` would include the date itself. A weigher never sees a
date, so it has no future to reach for.

**Never let the library make that cut, because it does not.** A returns-based method estimates over
whatever table it was built with, and `run_pipeline` builds each method once for every date, so over
a multi-date run the early books are sized on returns that had not happened yet. The library's own
changelog records it — *Known and open after 1.28.0*, 24% future observations in its integration
test — and says to slice the history yourself. So **build one allocator per rebalance date, on the
history already cut**, inside the weigher:

```python
eligible_history = history[list(selected)]
dated_history = eligible_history.rename_axis("date")
history_table = pyarrow.Table.from_pandas(
    dated_history.reset_index(),
    preserve_index=False,
)
allocator = build_allocator(
    name="inverse_volatility",
    config=InverseVolatilityConfig(),
    returns=history_table,
)
eligible_table = pyarrow.table(
    {
        "ticker": list(selected),
    }
)
snapshot = UniverseSnapshot(table=eligible_table)
allocated = allocator.allocate(snapshot=snapshot)
weights = Weights.from_allocated(allocated=allocated)
weight_by_security = pandas.Series(
    weights.as_mapping()
)
```

- **The history is wide** — a `date` column, then one numeric column per security; a timestamp or a
  `date32` date both read — and must carry **every** eligible security, or the method raises
  `AllocationError`. It needs at least two complete dates.
- **The factory checks the pairing.** A snapshot-only method refuses a `returns` argument and a
  returns-based one refuses to be built without it, so pass the history only when
  `requirements_for(name).history_input` says so. Snapshot methods read their columns from the
  snapshot table: put the feature there, as it stood before the date.
- **Weights sum to at most one, not to exactly one.** A method's book sums to its target exposure,
  1.0; the module scales it down when a lever asks for cash, and the residual becomes a real, priced
  cash position when the weight file is written. Nothing eligible is an empty book — 100% cash, kept
  as an all-zero row, because "went to cash" is an instruction the engine has to receive.

## 5. Eligibility and timing, point in time

The library lags nothing, and **a snapshot reads its values on the date it is built for.** So the
order is the module's, and it is fixed:

- **Lag the eligibility** so the set used on rebalance date *t* is the one observed at *t-1*, filled
  with False so the warm-up holds nothing rather than everything. A security has to have been
  authorised yesterday and be sellable today, and those are two different days on purpose.
- **Rebalance on change** when the rule is event-driven: the days the lagged set changed. A
  `BinaryMatrix` of the lagged signal counts entries and exits per date with `turnover()`. A
  calendar rule takes
  `CalendarRebalancer(trading_dates=..., frequency=RebalanceFrequency.MONTH_END)` on the panel's own
  dates — and yields a date for an incomplete last period too, so check the last one.

In a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository the eligible set comes from the refined panel — the rule
builds it from the `r_*` columns — and the library sizes it. If you do use its loaders and
`run_pipeline`, three traps are silent until they are not:

- **Snapshots match dates exactly.** A rebalance date the panel does not hold gives all-null
  features, every filter goes null and the run aborts. Take dates from the panel's own `date`
  column; `FixedDateRebalancer` checks nothing.
- **Warm-up nulls abort the whole run.** A 252-day column is null for a year, `EXCLUDE` removes
  every security, and one failing date stops every date with nothing written. Start after the
  warm-up.
- **Filters inside the pipeline are date-blind.** A selection stage receives a bare table, so a
  `MembershipFilter` on a dated `Classification` raises, or applies one date to all. Point-in-time
  membership comes from a per-date flag column (`BinaryFilter`) or
  `UniverseCreator.build_membership`, read per date with
  `BinaryMatrix.active_on(target_date=..., missing=MissingDataPolicy.EXCLUDE)`.

The loaders — `CsvInput` and `ParquetInput`, over the Curator's one-file-per-identifier folders —
read **numeric columns only**; a text column or a Parquet `NaN` fails with nothing more than *No
input handler succeeded*.

## 6. Constraints are levers, switched off

`build_weights(eligibility, returns, rebalance_dates, method, maximum_weight, minimum_holdings)`
takes the constraints as arguments beside the method, so two methods can be compared without also
changing the constraints:

| Argument | Off | What switching it on means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maximum_weight` | `None` | a cap, applied by `weigh`. **What it frees becomes cash.** The library's `Weights.cap` redistributes the excess to keep the book fully invested — a different lever; use it only when the blueprint names that one |
| `minimum_holdings` | 1 | below it the date holds nothing: the book is cash. The honest response to too few things to hold is to hold less |

Start with every constraint **off**, because a constraint is a lever a later experiment has
to earn against the simpler baseline. The library's richer machinery — a `Mandate` with group
limits, a tracking-error budget, Black-Litterman views — is a lever of the same kind: one at a time,
each beating the book without it. `liquid-golden-cross`, the template's worked example, sizes by
equal weight: the method every other one in the registry has to beat.

## 7. The weight file

In a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository `Experiments/backtest_engine.py` writes
`Portfolio/portfolio_weights.csv`: wide, `Ticker` first, one ISO date per column, every column
summing to exactly 1.0 with the residual in the cash proxy. Outside one, the library's exporter
writes the same layout — `PortfolioEntity.from_dict(weights_dict={"2025-01-02": {...}})`, then
`CsvOutputHandler(output_dir=..., filename="portfolio_weights.csv").write(portfolio=...,
config=None)` — with two things to know: it **upper-cases tickers**, which must still match the
market-data file names, and it **refuses negative weights**, so a long/short book cannot go through
it.

The attribution library does not read this file: it needs the book's **daily** weights, as the
engine marked them. That hand-off is `attribution-analysis-runs`.

## 8. The invariants every rule must pass

Cheap to check in section 2.1 of the notebook, expensive to discover inside a P&L. Whatever the
method:

- no book is more than fully invested, and none is negatively invested;
- no negative weights, if the strategy is long-only; gross and net within the limits the engine will
  be given, if it is not;
- **every security paid for today had its signal on the prior close** — check the signal itself, not
  the composed eligibility, because the signal is what had to exist in advance;
- every security bought is tradable on the day it is bought, so a fill price exists;
- nothing is still held on a day after it stopped being tradable.

Run them over **every** book an experiment builds, not only the benchmark's. A variant that holds a
name the benchmark could not is a bug wearing a Sharpe.

## What this skill will not let you do

- **Give a weigher a date**, or a history that reaches the rebalance date.
- **Build one returns-based allocator for many dates**, or run one through `run_pipeline` over a
  multi-date window.
- **Redistribute what a cap frees** unless the blueprint names that lever.
- **Choose a sizing method on the Sharpe it produces** over the window it will be judged on. Choose
  it on a property of the book — concentration, turnover, capacity — and publish the comparison.
- **Swap in equal weight because the library is missing.** Let the error stop the run.
- **Quote a number the engine did not produce.** This module builds weights; `backtest-engine-runs`
  prices them.
- **Use an in-house KaxaNuk strategy as a worked example.** Examples in this public package come
  from the worked example, `liquid-golden-cross`, only.

## Where the documentation is

The library has no public documentation site yet. Its repository carries it: `README.md` for the
principles and each method's card, `CHANGELOG.md` — read *Known and open* before trusting a feature
— and `examples/`. `references/api.md` is the surface this skill was checked against, with the
places where the README and the code disagree.
