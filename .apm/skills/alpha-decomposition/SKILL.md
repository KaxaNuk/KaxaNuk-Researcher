# Alpha decomposition — is the signal doing anything?

A book that beats its benchmark has not been understood. It has been observed. This skill is the
procedure that turns "the book went up" into "here is the part of the return that is the idea, and
here is the part that is beta, size, sector and luck" — the question `RESULTS.md` has to answer
before a strategy can graduate, and one this stack can actually answer because step 6 exists.

The method is Paleologo's (*Advanced Portfolio Management*, 2021, chapter 8): split total return
into factor and idiosyncratic, then split the idiosyncratic part three ways **by counterfactual
books, never by formula**. The book is listed in Part 0 of the template's
`Bibliotheca/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` as provenance, not as a note; write its note before citing it in a
findings file. Every counterfactual below is a weight file, so the same
`Experiments/backtest_engine.py` that priced the real book prices it, over the same window, at the
same costs — and when a counterfactual is attributed as well, the attribution reads *its* daily
weights from *its* backtest, never the real book's.

Work in the experiment's notebook, section 5 or a section after it. Record every number in
`FINDINGS_N.md`, then `RESULTS.md`. Publish the count of counterfactuals run.

## 1. First, two layers and a third pass — read what step 6 reports

Savvy investors follow a process, a thesis and data, and attribution gives all three about a book.
Run both methodologies (the experiment notebook's attribution cell does this) and record:

| Layer | From | Numbers to record | The question it answers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **First cut** | Brinson-Fachler | cumulative alpha; **allocation**, **selection**, **interaction** | is the return the groups the book leans into, or the names it picks inside them? The exact lever that moved |
| **Second layer** | the factor model | total excess; **factor** contribution by factor — beta, size, value, momentum, residual volatility, liquidity, industries — and the **idiosyncratic** residual | which systematic premia paid, on purpose or by accident? How much of this is a factor fund wearing the strategy's name? |
| **Third pass** | Brinson-Fachler on the residual | allocation and selection of the return left after factor exposure is stripped | does the selection story survive — and would the Sharpe survive once that factor turns? |

The third pass is what the first cut alone cannot give: a book that looks like skilful stock-picking
in Brinson-Fachler can be a persistent low-beta or momentum tilt that happened to pay over the
sample. The attribution library does not run Brinson-Fachler on residual returns directly, so build
the residual series from the factor model's output — `calc_pct_area()` names it `f_idio_returns`,
`cummulative_pct_decomp()` names it `idio_returns` — and run the first cut on it in the notebook,
saying in `FINDINGS_N.md` that it was done that way. Getting those tables out at all is
`attribution-analysis-runs`.

**Know what the library calls allocation.** KaxaNuk's Attribution Analysis computes the three
effects **per asset and per date** — its methodology page gives the formulas, and
`attribution-analysis-runs` repeats them — not by group. An allocation number is a statement about
groups only when the inputs were aggregated to groups first; `FINDINGS_N.md` says which was run.

**Check the benchmark is whole before reading any of it.** The first cut prices only the securities
the book's weight file names, so a book that lists only its holdings is compared with the part of
the index it owns — in the run that proved it, 6% of the index's return, with alpha five times too
large and the excess filed under interaction. Compare the first cut's `benchmark_returns` with the
index's own return over the same window; if they are not close, the book was not widened to every
constituent (`attribution-analysis-runs`, section 3) and no row of the table can be read yet.

Two readings, both of which count as answers:

- **Allocation ≈ 0 with selection and interaction positive**, on inputs aggregated to groups, means
  a large group tilt is *not* where the money comes from. Say so plainly; it is the opposite of what
  the tilt makes a reader assume.
- **A roughly even factor / idiosyncratic split** is a *pass with a qualification* on criterion 2.
  There is real idiosyncratic alpha, and half the excess is exposure available more cheaply
  elsewhere. Report both halves with equal weight.

State the attribution window beside the backtest window — it is bound by factor-file coverage and
benchmark-holdings start, and is usually shorter. Record how many factor files the run used;
attribution numbers are only comparable across runs when the factor set is identical.

## 2. When the factor model is blind — the absolute-versus-relative problem

**Momentum in a factor model is relative**: a name ranked against its peers. **A trend or regime
rule is absolute**: a name against its own history. The two produce different books from the same
names, and a factor model built on the relative kind is close to invisible to an absolute rule. So a
strategy can beat every benchmark while the model assigns roughly nothing to the factor its thesis
is named after.

**That is a finding, not a failure**, and it is the expected state for any threshold signal — a
moving-average cross, a breakout, a regime label, a drawdown gate. When you see it:

1. Say so in `FINDINGS_N.md`, in those terms.
2. Do not conclude the signal is weak. Conclude the model cannot see it, and go to section 4.
3. Rename the pillar in `OBJECTIVE.md` if it is called "momentum" and is a trend rule. The
   distinction predicts which factor model will see the strategy and which will not.

## 3. Then, the idiosyncratic part three ways — counterfactual books

Before any of them: **drop economically insignificant positions** from both the real book and the
counterfactuals, or the comparison is dominated by residual slivers nobody was betting on.

Each counterfactual keeps everything about the real book except one thing. The Sharpe difference
between the real book and the counterfactual, over the same engine window, is that one thing's
contribution. All three read the objects the experiment notebook already has — `selected_matrix`,
`REBALANCE_DATES`, `target_weights`, and the eligibility matrix the rule built them from, lagged as
the rule lagged it and called `eligible_matrix` below — and price each new `target_weights` the way
the worked example's counterfactual cell does: `securities_panel.expand_to_identifiers`, then
`backtest_engine.write_weight_file` under a name of its own, `backtest_engine.build_configuration`
with the real book's window and costs, and `backtest_engine.run_backtest`.

### 3a. Sizing skill — equalise positions within each date

Same names, same dates, every held position at equal weight. Side and gross unchanged.

```python
held = target_weights > 0
sizing_counterfactual = held.astype(float).div(held.sum(axis=1), axis=0).fillna(0.0)
```

**Sharpe(real) − Sharpe(equal-weighted) is what sizing contributed.** Positive means the big
positions were the good ones. This is the cheapest counterfactual and often already exists: an
equal-weight variant in the same experiment *is* this book — and for a benchmark that is already
equal weight, sizing skill is zero by construction and should be reported as such.

### 3b. Selection skill — a random draw from the eligible pool at the same sizes

Same dates, same number of names, same weight vector — but the names are drawn at random from
what was eligible that day. Repeat K times; K is a trial count and is published.

```python
rng = numpy.random.default_rng(seed)
draws = []
for _ in range(K):
    rows = []
    for date in REBALANCE_DATES:
        real = target_weights.loc[date]
        weights = numpy.sort(real[real > 0].to_numpy())[::-1]          # the real size distribution
        pool = eligible_matrix.loc[date]
        picked = rng.choice(pool.index[pool], size=len(weights), replace=False)
        rows.append(pandas.Series(weights, index=picked, name=date))
    draws.append(pandas.DataFrame(rows).reindex(columns=target_weights.columns).fillna(0.0))
```

Price every draw. **The real book's percentile among the K random books is the selection skill**;
the mean random Sharpe is what the eligibility rule plus the sizing scheme earn *without* picking.
Report the percentile and K, as a permutation test reports a p-value.

### 3c. Timing skill — the same names with entry dates shifted

Same selections, same weights, every re-strike moved by a fixed lag (5, 21 days) or to a random
date inside a window around the real one. If moving the entries costs nothing, the rule has no
timing skill — it is a selection rule that happens to fire on some day.

```python
shifted_dates = REBALANCE_DATES + pandas.tseries.offsets.BDay(lag)
timing_counterfactual = target_weights.set_axis(shifted_dates)
```

Clip to trading days that exist in the panel and drop any shifted date past the sample's end.

### Reading the three together

| Counterfactual | Sharpe gap to the real book | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| equal-weighted | small positive | sizing helps a little — say "a little", in Sharpe |
| random draw (mean) | large positive | the names matter; the rule is selecting, not just filtering |
| random draw (mean) | ≈ 0 | the eligibility filter plus sizing is the whole strategy |
| shifted entries | ≈ 0 | no timing skill; do not claim any |

Sizing plus selection plus timing does not have to sum to the idiosyncratic return — the
counterfactuals overlap. They are three questions, not a partition.

## 4. The exclusion-filter test — the counterfactual for an absolute rule

The direct test of whether a threshold signal earns its keep, and the fallback when section 2
applies: **the same book with the signal switched off.**

```python
# the rule's eligibility with only the signal's condition dropped; in the worked example
# `(signal > 0) & tradable` becomes `tradable`, which is `build_book(..., use_filter=False)`
eligible_without_signal = tradable_matrix                               # signal removed
# then re-run the experiment's own selection and weighting on this eligibility matrix
```

Same ranking column, same holding count, same weighting, same trigger — only the eligibility
condition changes. Price both. **Sharpe(with signal) − Sharpe(without) is what the signal
contributes as a filter**, which a factor model cannot measure.

**What a null result means.** If the two books are close, the signal is not adding beyond the
sizing rule's own selection, and the honest description of the strategy is "top-N by the sizing
column". That is worth knowing and belongs in `OBJECTIVE.md` as a falsified claim.

## 5. The worked example — `liquid-golden-cross`

The KaxaNuk Strategy Template works one strategy through the process in its worked example,
`examples/liquid-golden-cross/` in `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher`, which `init-example` copies into a
folder of its own: **`liquid-golden-cross`** — own the thirty most heavily traded US stocks whose
50-day simple moving average is above the 200-day, equally weighted at one thirtieth with a 2% cash
reserve, rebalanced only when the eligible top thirty differ from the book by 10%. It has run steps
1 to 6, so the numbers below are real: priced by the engine over one shared window, reported in
`Experiments/Experiment_1/FINDINGS_1.md`.

| Arm | What it removes | CAGR | Sharpe | **Idiosyncratic** |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| The rule | — | 17.85% | 0.861 | **45.52** |
| The equalised control | the trend filter | 18.97% | 0.831 | **40.47** |
| The plain control | the filter, and 76 of the 87 rebalances | 18.62% | 0.813 | **32.09** |
| Random, five seeds | the liquidity ranking | 3.29% to 9.42% | 0.17 to 0.48 | **−17.63 to 25.17** |

Each row is a lesson for this skill:

- **The signal the book is named after owns about five of its 45.5 idiosyncratic points** — 45.52
  against the equalised control's 40.47. The book beats its index and the factor model reports a
  large idiosyncratic share, and almost none of that share is the golden cross. Read the arms before
  crediting the signal in the name.
- **An absolute rule is nearly invisible to a relative model**, which is the problem section 2
  describes. `r_trend_50_200` compares a stock with its own past while the factor model is built on
  relative factors, so the exclusion-filter test of section 4 — the equalised control — is the arm
  that answers the question, not the factor split.
- **Most of the idiosyncratic share is the ranking, not the filter.** The random draws keep the
  sizing and the dates and replace only the liquidity ranking, and they land at a mean near 12.5
  against the rule's 45.52. Selection skill, section 3b, is where this book's return lives.
- **Sizing skill is zero by construction**, so section 3a has nothing to measure. Equal weight
  across whatever passes the screen *is* the sizing claim — report it as zero, not as a finding.
- **Timing was never priced, and the findings say so.** No shifted-entry arm was run, so section 3c
  reports nothing. An arm you did not run is reported as not run, never inferred from the ones you
  did.
- **The rule loses on return and wins on Sharpe.** It gives up 1.12 points of CAGR against the
  control that differs from it in exactly one thing, and buys 0.030 of Sharpe — and a drawdown 9.3
  points shallower than the same thirty names unfiltered. A decomposition that read return alone
  would have called the filter worthless.

## What this skill will not let you do

- **Call a strategy understood on the factor split alone.** The split says how much is
  idiosyncratic; the counterfactuals say what the idiosyncratic part is made of.
- **Run one random draw.** K is a trial count. Publish it, and report the percentile, not the best
  draw.
- **Tune on the counterfactuals.** They measure the rule you stated in `BLUEPRINT_N.md`. A rule
  changed to look better against its own counterfactual is a new experiment with a new blueprint.
- **Quote a number that did not come from the engine.** Every counterfactual is priced by
  `backtest_engine.run_backtest` over the shared window, never approximated.
- **Use an in-house KaxaNuk strategy as a worked example.** Examples in this public package come
  from the worked example, `liquid-golden-cross`, only.
