  Load this skill whenever a run of the KaxaNuk Attribution Analysis library is being set up,
  executed, debugged or read. Use it when the user asks to install `kaxanuk-attribution_analysis`,
  initialise its project files, shape the four inputs it reads (market data, daily portfolio and
  benchmark weights, benchmark returns, per-factor returns), turn a backtested book into the daily
  weights it requires, fill in `attribution_analysis_parameters.xlsx`, call the CLI or
  `performance_attribution.main`, drive `BrinstonFachlerArrowAttribution` or
  `KNFMArrowAttribution` directly, or get the allocation / selection / interaction and
  per-factor tables back out. It covers the exact input layouts, the traps that produce a
  clean-looking but wrong run, and how step 6 is called from a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository. It
  does NOT cover what the numbers mean for a strategy (use `alpha-decomposition`) or running the
  backtest that produced the book (use `backtest-engine-runs`).

# Running the KaxaNuk Attribution Analysis

Step 6 of the KaxaNuk Investment Lab: a book that beat its benchmark is taken apart into the pieces
that explain it. The library is **licensed** — not on public PyPI, and deliberately absent from the
KaxaNuk Strategy Template's `pyproject.toml` so its index URL and key never enter version control.
Its documentation is public, at
`https://kaxanuk-attribution-analysis.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/`, and this skill is written
against the **0.2.0** build of it. Go there for anything this file does not cover; this file keeps
what the documentation does not say, and what a KaxaNuk repository adds. Build 0.2.0 is the
frontmatter's `library_version`: compare it with the installed build `uv pip list` shows, and on a
newer minor or major version treat every trap here as unproven until it is checked again.

**This skill gets the numbers out. It does not read them.** What allocation, selection and the
idiosyncratic residual mean for a strategy — and the counterfactual books that turn the residual
into selection, sizing and timing — is `alpha-decomposition`.

## 1. Install it without leaking the key

The documentation's quick start has the command; the ready-to-run version, key included, arrives in
the licence welcome email. Run it from the repository root and through `uv`, so it lands in the
repository's `.venv` rather than wherever the first `pip` on the path points:

```bash
uv pip install kaxanuk-attribution_analysis --extra-index-url https://license:{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}@{SERVER}/simple/
```

Inside a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository that is all: in the worked example
`Experiments/attribution_analysis.py` shapes the inputs and the notebook builds the attribution
objects in code (sections 6 and 8), so there is no workbook and nothing at the root. Outside one,
lay down the project files once:

```bash
uv run kaxanuk.attribution_analysis init excel
```

Three rules, and the first is not negotiable:

- **Never print, echo or commit the key or the index URL** — not into a notebook output, a log line,
  a shell history or a dependency file. The command carries a credential: run it, do not paste it
  back. An exposed key is rotated, not edited out.
- **Never add the library to a repository's dependency file.** It is installed by hand, per machine,
  by whoever holds the licence.
- **Python 3.12 or 3.13** — the Backtest Engine's ceiling too, and part of why a KaxaNuk Strategy
  Template repository pins `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"`.

The licence key lives in `Config/.env` as **`KNAA_API_KEY_KAXANUK`** — a different variable from the
engine's `KNBE_API_KEY_KAXANUK`, and both sit in the same file; `~/.kaxanuk_license` or the exported
variable work too. **Never print the value of any of them.** The licence is checked against
KaxaNuk's server on every run, with a 24-hour local cache and a 7-day offline grace period: a run
that worked last week can fail today on a plane, and that is the licence, not the data.

**Keep it installed.** `uv sync` is *exact* by default and removes every package the lockfile does
not name, and this one is deliberately not in the lockfile. Once it is installed, after a relock use
`uv sync --inexact` with the repository's groups, run everything else through `uv run`, and check
`uv pip list | grep -i kaxanuk` before step 6. If the library has vanished, that is why, and the
install command is the fix.

## 2. Guard the import, always

A clone without a licence must still run everything else. Any module or cell that imports the
library reports what is missing and skips, rather than raising:

```python
import importlib.util

LIBRARY_INSTALLED = importlib.util.find_spec("kaxanuk.attribution_analysis") is not None
```

Check `LIBRARY_INSTALLED` before the call, and import
`kaxanuk.attribution_analysis.performance_attribution` only inside that branch, as the worked
example does (`report_missing_inputs` in `Experiments/attribution_analysis.py`, then the import in
the notebook's branch); where it is `False`, say plainly that step 6 was skipped for want of the
licensed library. A `try` around `from kaxanuk… import …` does the same job but fails Bloom Code
(BLOOM003). **A pipeline that dies at an optional import is a pipeline nobody can read.**

## 3. The four inputs

The layouts are on the documentation's *Data Formats* page; `init excel` lays down `Input/Data/`,
`Input/Portfolios/`, `Input/Benchmark_Portfolios/` and `Input/Factor_Models/`. What decides whether
a run is right:

**The first header decides everything, and it is not what the documentation says.** A weight file is
read as horizontal when its first header is `Ticker` and as vertical when it is **`date_column`** —
`StandardField.DATE.value`, case-insensitive, checked on 0.2.0 by running it. Anything else raises
`MissingPortfolioError: First column must be 'Ticker' or 'date_column'` before a number is read.
*Data Formats* and `detect_portfolio_format`'s own docstring both say `Date`/`date`, and both are
wrong; `date` is rejected. The same rule governs the portfolio weights, the benchmark weights and
the benchmark returns file.

**The weights are daily.** Portfolio and benchmark weights alike, no nulls. **Once a weight table
spans a year or more, the library requires 240 to 260 rows a year** in its first and last year and
raises `DataIntegrityError` otherwise, precisely to catch a rebalance-only file passed by mistake.
So the weight file a Backtest Engine priced — one column per rebalance date — **cannot be passed
in**, whatever the *Data Formats* example suggests. The attribution reads the book as it was
actually held each trading day, drift included (section 8).

**Market data — one file per security**, `{TICKER}.csv` or `{TICKER}.parquet`, with the date and
price columns named in the configuration (`user_column_date`, `user_column_price`); returns are
computed from the prices, and the Data Curator's `m_date` and `m_close_dividend_and_split_adjusted`
drop straight in. **Use the price basis the backtest marked on**: in a KaxaNuk Strategy Template
repository that is the dividend-and-split-adjusted close, and a split-adjusted column would drop
every dividend from the attribution. Dates must be `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY/MM/DD`. **A blank price in
any row read fails that security, and one failed security aborts the whole load** with a single
`DataLoadingError` naming them all — so trim a file's rows before its first price and after its
last.

**Benchmark returns** go through the same portfolio loader, so they take the same two shapes: one
row of dates-as-columns, or a vertical file whose first header is `date_column` and whose single
other column is the index's daily return. Checked on 0.2.0: the vertical form loads and is reported
as one ticker.

**Per-factor returns — one CSV per factor**: the first column is the date, then one column per asset
holding that factor's return *for that asset*. **The first header may be empty** — the loader takes
the first column whatever it is called, and a file whose header row starts with a bare comma loads
(checked on 0.2.0). Five things about that directory, none of which announces itself:

- **The file name is the factor name**, cut at the first dot: `f_residual.volatility.csv` silently
  becomes `f_residual`, and two names that collide overwrite each other.
- **Every entry in the directory is read as a factor file**; only `.gitkeep` is skipped. A stray
  `notes.md` or `.DS_Store` fails there, not with a message about the directory.
- **Only the portfolio's own tickers are read.** A column for a name the book never held is skipped
  in 0.2.0, and a held name missing from a factor file lowers that factor's coverage instead of
  raising. The run logs `Average total factor coverage throughout the portfolio`, as a percentage,
  and `Factor '<name>': reading k/n asset columns` per file. **Read both.** Low coverage means the
  factor attribution describes part of the book.
- **An explicit `start_date` earlier than a factor file's first date raises `DateRangeError`**,
  while a late `end_date` is quietly clamped.
- **Observed in the 0.2.0 source, not promised by the documentation:** `f_market`,
  `f_total_factor_returns`, `f_total_excess_returns` and `f_idyo_returns` are dropped from the
  percentage decomposition, which uses `f_total_excess_returns` as its denominator when present.
  Name a factor one of these by accident and it vanishes without a word. The plots group on exactly
  `f_size`, `f_momentum`, `f_beta`, `f_residual volatility` (with the space), `f_value` and
  `f_<GICS sector>`; any other name still attributes and lands in neither panel.

**Widen the book to the benchmark, or the first cut compares it with a fraction of the index.**
`main()` loads market data only for the securities named in the *portfolio* weight file, and the
first cut computes the benchmark's return from those prices alone — the benchmark returns file never
enters it. Benchmark weight on a name the book does not list has no return and silently drops out.
**List every benchmark constituent in the portfolio file, at zero weight where it is not held, each
with a price series.** Proved on 0.2.0 with a book of 8 names inside a 788-name index, the other 780
priced to earn exactly the index's daily return:

| First cut | Book only | Widened |
| --- | --- | --- |
| benchmark return, as a share of the index's own | 6.0% | 98.9% |
| alpha | +0.8845 | +0.1735 |
| interaction | +0.7415 | +0.0399 |
| portfolio return | +0.9305 | +0.9305 |

Unwidened, the benchmark was the 7.3% of the index the book happened to own, alpha came out about
five times too large, and nearly all of the excess was filed under **interaction** — the effect
least likely to be questioned. The book's own return did not move, which is what zero weights should
do. The last 1.1% was the 8 held names earning their own returns rather than the index's.

## 4. Configure it

`Config/attribution_analysis_parameters.xlsx`, one **General** sheet: the parameter name in A (**do
not touch**), your value in B, the description in C. The documentation's *Configuration Reference*
has every row; `references/configuration.md` has them with the traps below. The ones that decide the
run are the two methods (`brinson_fachler_method`, `factor_model_method`, independent), the two
columns read from your market data, the formats (lowercase), and the window (`YYYY-MM-DD` or
`auto`).

Three traps:

- **`portfolio_input_format = excel` does not complete.** In 0.2.0 the benchmark-returns handler is
  still built only on the `csv` branch, so the Excel branch reaches an unbound name. Keep the
  weights as `.csv`, and report it upstream rather than working around it silently.
- **Three directories are joined onto `input_directory`** — the portfolio weights, the benchmark
  weights and the benchmark returns — while `investable_assets_directory` and
  `factor_returns_by_factor_directory` are used as given. Moving `input_directory` moves the first
  three and leaves the market data and the factors where they were.
- **`ExcelConfigurator` ends the process on a bad cell**: it logs the configuration error and calls
  `sys.exit`, so in a notebook a typo arrives as `SystemExit`, not as an exception you can read. A
  notebook or a sweep builds `Configuration` directly, which raises `ConfigurationError` at
  construction instead — and **a sweep that edits a workbook between runs is a sweep nobody will
  reproduce.**

## 5. Run it

The CLI, from the project root and through `uv run`, is on the documentation's *CLI* page; a
KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository calls the library in code instead (sections 6 and 8). Two
details it is easy to misread: `autorun` on a fresh folder **installs the project files and exits**
— it runs only on the next call — and `run` executes each entry script as its own subprocess.

In code, the documented sequence — *Running from Python* — is four calls, and the first two are not
optional in a notebook:

```python
load_config_env()
configure_logger(
    logger_name="kaxanuk.attribution_analysis",
    logger_level=logging.INFO,
    logger_format="[%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
    logger_file=None,
)
parameters_path = pathlib.Path("Config") / "attribution_analysis_parameters.xlsx"
configurator = ExcelConfigurator(parameters_path)
performance_attribution.main(
    configurator.get_configuration(),
    launch_dashboard=False,
    dashboard_port=configurator.get_dashboard_port(),
)
```

`load_config_env()` is what reads `Config/.env`, and without `configure_logger` at `INFO` the
coverage and date-range lines this skill tells you to read never print. The imports are
`services.env_loader`, `services.configuration_logger`, `config_handlers.excel_configurator` and
`performance_attribution`, under `kaxanuk.attribution_analysis`.

- **`dashboard_port` is keyword-only and has no default** — required even with the dashboard off,
  whatever the `main()` examples in the documentation show.
- **`main()` shows plots itself.** With Brinson-Fachler on it always draws its figure, and with
  `launch_dashboard=False` it draws the factor model's too — each through `plt.show()`. In a script,
  a notebook batch or CI, call `matplotlib.use("Agg")` before `main()`, or the run blocks on a
  window nobody will close.

## 6. Read what comes back

**`main()` writes no files.** It returns `None`: log lines, figures, and perhaps a dashboard. The
quick start, the Excel workflow and the CLI page all say results are written to `Output/`; nothing
is. **To get numbers back, build the two attribution objects yourself** and read their attributes:

```python
brinson = BrinstonFachlerArrowAttribution(
    returns_investable_assets=asset_returns,
    complete_portfolio_weights=portfolio_weights,
    complete_benchmark_weights=benchmark_weights,
    date_column="date",
)
brinson.time_series_calculation()          # sets .df and .output_dict
brinson.attribution_plots()                # sets .brinston_fach_indexes, and calls plt.show()
```

| Attribute | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `.df` | the daily totals: `date`, `portfolio_returns`, `benchmark_returns`, `alpha`, `allocation`, `selection`, `interaction`; zero rows, full schema, when no date qualifies |
| `.output_dict` | date to per-asset detail: `asset`, both weights, `returns_data`, both returns, `alpha` and the three effects |
| `.brinston_fach_indexes` | the cumulative sums — the series to quote. Set only by `attribution_plots()` |

**Read the effects the way the library defines them.** Its *Brinson-Fachler* methodology page
computes them **per asset and per date**: with `r` the asset's return, `r_b = w_b · r`, and
`alpha = w_p · r − r_b`, allocation is `(w_p − w_b) · r_b`, selection is `alpha · w_p`, and
interaction the remainder. That is not the textbook group-level split, so an *allocation* number is
not a sector bet unless the inputs were built as groups. Say which you mean when you quote one.

```python
factor_returns = load_by_factor_returns_arrow(
    path=factor_directory,
    available_factors=factor_file_names,
    portfolio_weights=portfolio_weights_entity,
)
factor_tables = {
    factor_name: factor.table
    for factor_name, factor in factor_returns.items()
}
factor_model = KNFMArrowAttribution(
    daily_portfolio_weights=portfolio_weights,
    by_factor_factor_returns=factor_tables,
    asset_returns=asset_returns,
    benchmark_returns=benchmark_returns,
    date_column="date",
)
factor_model.run()                         # sets .portfolio_attribution_ts and .simulated_rets
factor_model.calc_pct_area()               # sets .pct_df_returns
decomposition = factor_model.cummulative_pct_decomp()
```

`load_by_factor_returns_arrow` returns `FactorReturns` entities; the class wants their tables.
`.portfolio_attribution_ts` is the daily contribution per factor, `.simulated_rets` its cumulative
sum, `.pct_df_returns` the daily percentage split, and `cummulative_pct_decomp()` a dict: each
factor's share of total excess return at the last date. Tables are `pa.Table`; `.to_pandas()` at the
analysis boundary.

Note the names, none of which is a typo you may fix. The first cut is
**`Brinston`**`FachlerArrowAttribution` with `.brinston_fach_indexes`, while its method is
`brinson_fachler_model`; its constructor takes `returns_investable_assets` where the interface
spells it `returns_investible_assets`. **The factor model class is `KNFMArrowAttribution`** — the
documentation calls it `FactorModelArrowAttribution` throughout, and importing that name from
`interfaces.factor_model_arrow_attribution` raises `ImportError` on 0.2.0. The module path keeps the
`factor_model` spelling; only the class is `KNFM`.

Four things to know before quoting any of it:

- **The idiosyncratic residual has three spellings.** `f_idio_returns` is the column
  `calc_pct_area()` creates; `idio_returns` is the key `cummulative_pct_decomp()` returns;
  `f_idyo_returns` is a reserved input name both drop. Say which one a quoted number came from.
- **The percentage decomposition divides by the day's total return.** On days near zero the ratio
  explodes, and the library forward-fills the non-finite result. Read `.pct_df_returns` as a shape
  and quote `cummulative_pct_decomp()` for a number.
- **Everything is aligned to the intersection of every input's date range**, and the run logs it as
  `Aligned all tables to common date range`. One short factor file shortens the whole analysis;
  state the common range beside the backtest window. An intersection with no dates raises rather
  than returning an empty result.
- `summary_stats(returns)`, in `modules.performance_functions`, gives the one-row frame the
  dashboard shows; the whole module is public, so a figure in a document can be recomputed from the
  series. Its functions do not infer periods per year — pass them.

## 7. The dashboard

With `factor_model_method` on and `launch_dashboard=True`, a Dash app is served on `dashboard_port`
(1–9999, typically 8050). **It needs the factor model**: with only Brinson-Fachler, static
matplotlib plots are what you get. `run_server` **blocks**, and runs with `debug=True` by default.
Never launch it from an automated run, a scheduled job or a notebook you expect to finish: pass
`launch_dashboard=False` and read the tables.

## 8. Inside a KaxaNuk Strategy Template repository

Step 6 reads what step 5 produced, and `Experiments/attribution_analysis.py` shapes it:

- **The book's daily weights, not `Portfolio/portfolio_weights.csv`.** That file is the book on its
  rebalance dates, which the library rejects. Take the weights the engine actually held each trading
  day — `Daily_Weights` in its results, verified on engine 0.66.0 — reshape them to one row per
  trading day with `date_column` first, keep the cash position, drop the engine's benchmark column
  (it comes back at zero), and **widen them to every benchmark constituent at zero weight** (section
  3). The engine names only what was held, so the widening is a step of its own, and every added
  name needs a price series in the market-data directory.
- **The benchmark's daily weights and its daily returns** belong to the experiment, not to the
  library's defaults, with the same density rule. A benchmark chosen after seeing the result is not
  a benchmark.
- **The desk's files are read as the desk ships them**, by `Data/hand_supplied.py`: the index's
  holdings and returns under `Benchmark Portfolios/`, the factor model under `Factor Models/`, or
  under the older `Benchmarks/` and `Factors/`, in place from the folder `KN_ANALYTICS_PATH` names,
  or from the drop zones `Benchmarks/` and `Factors/` under `Data/Curator/`. It parses the
  desk's `m_date` headers — ISO in the holdings, day first in the returns — and gives the model's
  own series their reserved names, `Market.csv` as `f_market` and so on. Never rename or re-head a
  desk file by hand: a renamed copy drifts from the one the desk refreshes.
- `Experiments/Experiment_N/Attribution/` is where output lands, and **nothing in it is committed**:
  no workbooks, no charts, no dashboards. The numbers reach `FINDINGS_N.md`, and `RESULTS.md` is
  compiled from those.
- **Record the factor set** — how many files, and their names — and the coverage line. Attribution
  numbers are only comparable across runs when the factor set is identical, and the file names *are*
  the factor set.

Then hand off. `alpha-decomposition` takes it from the tables: two layers and a third pass, and the
counterfactual books that say what the residual is made of.

## What this skill will not let you do

- **Pass a rebalance-only weight file** and work around the error it raises. The library is right;
  derive the daily book.
- **Quote a number this library did not produce.** The agent never computes an attribution figure
  itself; it shapes inputs, calls the library and reads tables back.
- **Report a factor split without its coverage.** The coverage line and the count of factor files
  travel with every attribution number.
- **Treat an empty `Output/` as a failed run.** It is what `main()` does; read the attributes
  instead.
- **Silently accept a shortened window.** The common date range is an output, and it is stated.
- **Use an in-house KaxaNuk strategy as a worked example.** Examples in this public package come
  from the worked example, `liquid-golden-cross`, only.
