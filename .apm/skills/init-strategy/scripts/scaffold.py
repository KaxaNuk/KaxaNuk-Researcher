"""
Copy a KaxaNuk starting point into a new folder: a researcher's home, a strategy, an example, or a Python library.

The starting points ship inside the KaxaNuk Researcher package — `templates/researcher/`,
`templates/strategy/`, `templates/python-library/` and the worked examples, one folder each under
`examples/<kind>/<name>/` — and this script copies one of them byte for byte, so every folder made
from the same package version starts identical.  Nothing is written from memory and nothing is
generated; what a checkout, an install, a build or an agent may leave in a starting point — a cache
folder, an agent's folder, `apm_modules/`, `uv.lock`, `Config/.env`, `dist/`, `docs/_build/` — is
left behind, by a whole copy and by `--only` alike.

Usage:
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py researcher <destination>
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py strategy <destination>
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py example <destination>
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py example <destination> --name golden-flow
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py examples
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py examples --kind strategy
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py python-library <destination>
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py strategy <strategy root> --only Data/analyzer.ipynb
    uv run --no-project python scaffold.py example <a folder of its own> --only Experiments/Experiment_1

An example is a folder `examples/<kind>/<name>/` that holds a `README.md`: its kind is what it is
an example of, `strategy` for `examples/strategy/golden-flow/`, and its name is its own.  `examples`
lists them, one line each, `<kind>/<name> — <its line>`: the line its README marks, alone at
column 0 as `<!-- kaxanuk-example: <its line> -->`, or else its first paragraph's first sentence,
links and emphasis made plain.  `--kind` lists one kind only.  `example` copies the one example
that `--kind` and `--name` leave — the package's only one when neither is given; a name alone, or
`<kind>/<name>` where two kinds share it — and when several are left, or none, it copies nothing
and lists them.  A whole copy's first commit names it:
`Start from the KaxaNuk example <kind>, <name>`.

Without `--only`, the destination must not exist or must be an empty folder — one holding only
what Finder or Explorer leaves, `FILE_MANAGER_FILES`, counts as empty, and those files stay on disk
and out of the commit; the copy is then made a git repository on branch `main` with one first
commit, unless `--no-git`.  With `--only`, one path of the starting point is copied into an
existing folder: a file already there with the same content is skipped, and one with other content
stops the run before anything is written, so nothing is overwritten.  The path is relative and
stays inside both the starting point and the folder: one that is absolute, or that leads outside
either through `..`, is refused before anything is read.  A piece of the example goes into a folder
of its own, never into a strategy, whose file of the same name is the template's.

The package is found beside this script when it runs from a checkout of KaxaNuk-Researcher, then
under `apm_modules/` in the folder it runs from or any folder above it, then under `~/.apm/`, where
`apm install -g` puts it.  `--package` names it outright.  A destination or a `--package` that
starts with `~` starts in the user's home folder.  The first line printed names the package found
and the version its `apm.yml` gives, so a copy from a stale install shows it.

On Windows, unless long paths are enabled, a path stops at 259 characters and a folder at 247.  A
copy whose longest path would reach 260 characters, or whose deepest folder would reach 248, is
refused before anything is written, exit code 1: the message names that path and how short a
destination would do.  Where the platform allows long paths, or is not Windows, there is no check.

Exit code 0 when the copy was made, or when `examples` listed one at least; 1 when not; 2 for a
command line it cannot read, such as `examples` given a destination or `strategy` a `--name`.  A
copy the operating system stops partway — a full disk, a file it refuses — is reported in one line
with the file and the system's reason: a new folder's partial copy can be deleted, and a run with
`--only` run again, skipping what it copied.  A git step that fails — git not installed, no
identity for the commit — leaves the copy in place and the exit code 0, and is reported with every
command that finishes the repository by hand, from the failed step on.  git's output is decoded as
UTF-8 and printed as ASCII; the script's own messages are ASCII, but for paths, an example's line
and the dash before it, and the console is written in UTF-8, so a path in any alphabet prints.
