  Load this skill whenever the owner asks what their library says, what they have read about a
  topic, how two sources relate, or what evidence there is for a claim — any question to answer
  from the library, Philosophy/ and the sources rather than general knowledge: Knowledge/ at home,
  a strategy's Bibliotheca/ when invited there — or how their own view has changed, from the rounds
  in Philosophy/Evolution/. It walks the index and the links before reading, and cites every claim.
  It does NOT write code or answer questions about files outside the library.

# Query — answer from what was read, and say where it came from

Every path below is relative to the researcher's home — the folder that holds `RESEARCHER.md`. Find
it first and read its `RESEARCHER.md` and `AGENTS.md`. In a strategy — the session is open in a
repository with a `Bibliotheca/`, or the owner named one by path — *Working in a strategy* in
`AGENTS.md` says where each of these paths lands.

The question is what the owner asked, in their words. They built this library so that answers
rest on sources they chose. Answering from general knowledge defeats the point; answering from one
note in isolation misses the connections that are the library's value.

1. **Index first.** Read the library's index end to end — `Knowledge/INDEX.md` at home,
   `Bibliotheca/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` in a strategy, where a row without a note is a lead and not a
   source. Note every note whose line bears on the question, in any domain or part, and for a book
   the chapters read. At home, start with the concept pages under *Concepts* — a question usually
   lands on one — and follow them to the source notes they cite. Never answer from one note in
   isolation.
2. **Follow the links.** Open those notes and follow the standard markdown links between them
   until the map of what the library holds on this question is complete. Two notes that link to
   each other are one argument; read both. Quote the source's terms where they matter.
3. **Then the owner's voice.** Read the relevant files in `Philosophy/` at home when the owner's
   own synthesis is more specific than the library, and cite them as the owner's view, distinct
   from the sources' — in a strategy, by name in prose, never by link; never a round file in
   `Philosophy/Evolution/`, a record, as the home's `AGENTS.md` says. A study in `Studies/` that
   bears on the question is the owner's work in the same way: name it as theirs, never as evidence
   — its claims rest on the notes it links, and those are what the answer cites.
4. **In a strategy, then the home library.** Walk `Knowledge/INDEX.md` at home for what the
   researcher has read that the strategy has not. Report it as the researcher's library, not the
   strategy's, and say that the strategy cannot cite it until the source has a note in its
   `Bibliotheca/` — a lead for `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md`, offered, never written on its own.
5. **Then the raw material,** only if the library is thin: read the source directly, and say the
   library has no note for it yet.
6. **Answer in chat**, with a standard markdown link to every note behind every claim. Where
   sources disagree, say so and show both; a `> [!WARNING]` callout in a note means a
   claim has been superseded — report the newer one.
7. **Offer to keep the answer.** At home, when the answer drew on three or more notes, ask through
   the question tool whether to keep it as a synthesis page — the shape is in `references/note.md`
   in the `read` skill's folder — its *Go* described as *write it and save a version*, and write
   it on *Go* only: the page itself, under the domain; its one line under *Concepts* in
   `Knowledge/INDEX.md`, title and one-line definition; and one entry appended to
   `Knowledge/LOG.md`, `## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | kept a synthesis page`, with the page's path.
   Nothing else. **Then save a version**, in the home, on that go, with no second question — every
   git command, the `backup` skill's send included, as `git -C "<absolute path to the home>"` when
   the session is open elsewhere: `git add` those three files by name, never `--all`, and
   `git commit -m "Query: kept <page>" -- <the same files>`; one plain line, *Saved*, never the
   commands. When `git config --get kaxanuk.autosend` prints `true`, it is also sent to the owner's
   copy on GitHub, as the `backup` skill says. This replaces the *Commit?* question an older home's
   `AGENTS.md` describes. A save refused for want of a name and an e-mail asks for both in one plain
   line — *a name and an e-mail to sign the versions your researcher saves* — sets them in the home
   only, never invented, and saves again; a home with no `.git/` gets one line, that it keeps no
   versions yet.
   In a strategy, never a page: `OBJECTIVE.md` is the strategy's synthesis.
8. **Name the gaps.** If the library does not hold what the question needs, say exactly that, and
   suggest the source that would close it: by year, authors and title when
   `references/reading-map.md` in the `read` skill's folder lists one — labelled *a lead from the
   reading map, not in your library*, or *in your Sources/, not yet read* when the PDF is there —
   and otherwise the kind of source. Where the map gives a work's other side and the library holds
   only one of the two, name the other. Outside the map, two works may be named: one the owner
   wrote on a *Find first* line of `RESEARCHER.md`, labelled *on your Find first line*, and a file
   already in `Sources/`, labelled *in your Sources/, not yet read*. Every other suggestion outside
   the map names no work — no title, author or year, not even labelled as memory: the kind of
   source is the whole suggestion. Do not answer from memory without saying you did, and never
   write it into the library during a query.

## How has my view changed

When the owner asks how their own view has moved — *how has my view changed?*, *what did I say
about my benchmark the first time?* — the answer is not in the library but in the rounds
`philosophy` writes: one file each in `Philosophy/Evolution/`, named by its date, `YYYY-MM-DD.md`,
and a second round the same day `YYYY-MM-DD-2.md`. This is the one question a round file answers,
and it is quoted as the record of a round, never as the owner's standing view.

1. **The rounds, oldest first** — by the date in the name, and on one date by its suffix. Read each
   one's first line, `# Round <N> · <date> · <level>`, and its lines by question ID:
   `- <ID> · <answer>`, or on a retake `- <ID> · <label> · <answer>`, the label *kept*, *changed*,
   *new* or *still open*. A *kept* line carries no answer: the words are the latest earlier
   round's for that ID, quoted with that round's date. A question answered before and skipped or
   explained now carries no label, only its status, and its earlier answer stands. An answer is
   the owner's typed words, or a status — *not sure yet*, *skipped*, *explained*. A round holds
   nothing else, so nothing else is quoted from it.
2. **Compare by ID.** For each question asked in more than one round, use the label the later
   line carries, against the latest earlier answer; where a line carries none, say *kept*,
   *changed*, *new* or *still open* as `philosophy` defines them, and *not asked again* for a
   question answered before and only skipped or explained since. Quote each answer word for word,
   in the owner's language, beside its round's date and level — *2026-10-04, Starter* — naming the
   round by its date in prose, never by a link: a round file is a record, never cited. The levels
   then and now are said once.
3. **The reading in between**: the notes, linked, that the `read` entries of `Knowledge/LOG.md`
   list as written, dated on or after the earlier round's date and before the later one's — a
   read the same day as a round counts after it, as `philosophy` counts it. Name them as what was
   read in between, never as the cause: whether a note moved the owner is theirs to say.
4. **The standing view is `HOW-I-INVEST.md`.** Where an earlier answer that later changed still
   stands there as a line, say so: the owner edits it by hand, or with `refine`, never this skill.

With no round file, say so in one line, and that `philosophy` takes round 1; with one, quote it
with its date and level, and say there is nothing to compare yet. In a strategy the rounds are read
at home and named in prose. Nothing is written: the comparison lives in chat, and is never kept as a
synthesis page.

## Numbers

A performance figure — a return, a Sharpe ratio, a drawdown, a turnover, an information
coefficient, an attribution — is quoted **only from the file that owns it**: an experiment's
`FINDINGS_N.md`, the strategy's `RESULTS.md`, or, for a measurement of step 3, *Before any
experiment* in `RESULTS.md` and the `Data/analyzer.ipynb` section it cites. Name that file beside
the figure. Never recompute it, round it, combine two figures into a third, or carry one from one
strategy to another as though the window, the universe and the costs were the same. A figure in a
source is the source's — the answer says whose it is, and never lets a paper's number stand as the
strategy's.

## What this skill will not let you do

- Invent a source, a page or a URL. Where the library, `Philosophy/` and the sources hold nothing,
  the honest answer is that the library does not know, and what to read to find out.
- Modify the library, `Philosophy/`, `Studies/` or the sources while answering, beyond the three
  files step 7 writes on the owner's go, never a note — and in a strategy, write anything at home.
- Quote a performance number that did not come from the engines the project names, or from
  anywhere but the file that owns it — *Numbers*, above.
