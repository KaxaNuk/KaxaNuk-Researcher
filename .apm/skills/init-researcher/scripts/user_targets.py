"""
Keep the researcher installed for every assistant it is used on: put the assistant in use on the
list APM keeps in `~/.apm/apm.yml`, and check that the researcher's files are on disk for it.

APM writes that list, `targets:`, only when an install creates the file, with the one assistant
that install named.  An install for a second assistant leaves the list as it is, and the next
install or update without `--target` deletes every file of the second as belonging to no listed
assistant, and still exits 0.  An assistant on the list keeps its files through every install and
update; a file with no list at all lets APM find every assistant whose folder exists, and delete
nothing.

Usage:
    uv run --no-project python user_targets.py add <assistant>
    uv run --no-project python user_targets.py check <assistant> <slug>

The assistant is claude, codex, copilot, cursor, gemini, opencode or windsurf; the slug is the
researcher's name as its files take it, `sofia` for Sofía.  In a conversation where the
init-researcher skill is not loaded yet, run it from the installed package, `<package>` standing
for `$HOME/.apm/apm_modules/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher` — `$HOME`, never `~`, which a program
handed it does not expand:
    uv run --no-project python "<package>/.apm/skills/init-researcher/scripts/user_targets.py" add codex

`add` reads `apm.yml` in the `.apm` folder of the user's home folder.  When it names its
assistants, under `targets:` or the older `target:` — a list of lines starting `- `, a list in
brackets, or one name — and the assistant is not among them, it is added to that list: a line of
its own after the last, or the bracketed list rewritten on its line, and every other line stays as
it was, its line endings included.  An assistant already listed, or a file that names none, changes
nothing.  A missing file, which the package's install creates, a list that cannot be read here —
brackets over several lines, or no names — or a list named twice changes nothing either, and
exits 1.

`check` looks in the user's home folder for the package's `next` skill and the researcher's skill
and agent, where APM puts them for the assistant:

    assistant           the skills, next and <slug>   the researcher's agent
    claude              .claude/skills/               .claude/agents/<slug>.md
    codex               .agents/skills/               .codex/agents/<slug>.toml
    copilot             .agents/skills/               .copilot/agents/<slug>.agent.md
    cursor              .agents/skills/               .cursor/agents/<slug>.md
    gemini, windsurf    .agents/skills/               none: neither takes an agent
    opencode            .config/opencode/skills/      none: next alone

OpenCode receives the package but never the researcher, which the home leaves out by design.  Each
missing file is named on a line of its own.  The check also fails when `apm.yml` lists assistants
and not this one, since the next install or update would delete the files it found.

Exit code 0 when the assistant is listed, or needs no list, or the researcher is installed for it;
1 when not; 2 for a command line that cannot be read.  The console is written in UTF-8, so a path
in any alphabet prints; the script's own words are ASCII.
