"""
The figures a note states, looked up on the pages it cites: the check `audit deep` runs.

For every figure a note writes beside a page citation, it opens the extract of the note's
`local_copy` — the folder `extract.py` writes — and looks for the figure on the cited pages, then
on every other page of the extract. It reads; it never edits a note or an extract, and it has no
opinion about whether a figure is right: one on its cited page may still be quoted out of context,
and one found nowhere may be the note's own arithmetic. It says where to look.

    uv run check_numbers.py Knowledge                       every note under Knowledge/, extracts in ./Extracts
    uv run check_numbers.py NOTE.md BOOK_FOLDER --extracts Bibliotheca/Extracts
    uv run check_numbers.py Knowledge/Finance --verbose     every figure, not only those not found

What it reads
    a note      a markdown file; a folder is walked for *.md, leaving out INDEX.md, LOG.md and the
                concept and synthesis pages, whose frontmatter carries `type:`
    its source  the frontmatter's `local_copy`, a PDF, whose extract is <extracts>/<slug>/ — the
                slug made by extract.py's own slugify — every chapter file there split at its
                `<!-- p.N -->` markers
    a citation  p. 93 · pp. 12–13 · pp. 12-13 · pp. 5, 9, 12 · (p. 7), outside a markdown link
    a figure    a number of two digits or more in the same paragraph, list item, heading or table
                row as a citation: decimals, thousands separators, a percent, a minus of any kind.
                Not a number inside a markdown link, inline code or a URL, not the citation itself,
                and not the section number opening a heading. Compared without separators, percent
                or sign: a PDF's minus comes out as a hyphen, a dash or a glyph of its own

Each figure is on page (a cited page holds it), elsewhere (another page does, listed; when at least
three of the lines holding a note's figures found elsewhere, and most of them, sit at one offset
from the cited page, the note may cite printed pages), or not found. A figure whose cited pages are
none of them in the extract, and that no page holds, is counted as not extracted. A block with
figures and no citation is counted, not checked. A note whose local_copy is not a PDF, or whose
extract is not on disk, is unchecked, with the reason and the extract.py command that would
regenerate it.

Options
    --extracts DIR  the extracts root (default ./Extracts)
    --verbose       every figure with its outcome, not only those not found

Exit codes: 0 no figure not found · 1 usage: a path that does not exist, no note to read, or a
command line the parser rejects · 2 at least one figure not found.
Without uv: pip install "pypdf[crypto]", then python check_numbers.py ... — extract.py, beside
this file, needs it.
