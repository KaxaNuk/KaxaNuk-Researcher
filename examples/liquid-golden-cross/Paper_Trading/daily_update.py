"""
The daily run over every graduated book -- step 7 of the KaxaNuk Strategy Template.

In plain words: once a day, after the market closes, refresh the data, run each frozen strategy
exactly as it was when it graduated, price it with the engine, and write down what happened --
how the book is doing over its whole history and since the day it was frozen, and anything that
does not look like the backtest said it would.

A graduated book is a frozen copy of the strategy, made once by `promote.py`: the files it needs,
copied byte for byte into `Paper_Trading_N/` in the strategy's own layout, with `FREEZE.json`
naming the commit, the date and the hash of each.  Every path in those copies resolves inside the
book's folder, so an experiment under construction can change the shared modules and the graduated
book never moves.  **A paper-trading run re-fits nothing**: a run that tunes anything is a
backtest wearing a costume, and it answers a question nobody asked.

What one run does, in order:

1. Takes a lock, so two runs never overlap -- a lock a killed run left for twelve hours is
   removed, and the log says so -- and writes its log to `Paper_Trading/Logs/`.
2. Refreshes the shared raw data once -- `Data/curator.py` with the day as its end date -- or,
   with `PAPER_TRADING_INPUT=database`, reads the panel another machine published.
3. Checks the newest day before any book reads it: a close with no fill price, a move no price can
   make, a cash or benchmark file behind the day, an index file behind it.  A check that fails
   stops every book before anything is written: a book on broken data is worse than none.
4. For each book in `BOOKS`: compares every frozen file with its hash in `FREEZE.json` -- the
   security master, which is never committed, among them -- and the Curator's calculations with
   the ones frozen, links the raw files into the book's folder, and calls
   `paper_trading_N.run(as_of)`, which runs the frozen refinery and rule and prices the book and
   its control twice -- over the whole history and since the freeze.  A frozen file missing or
   changed stops the book, as a changed calculation does.
5. Writes the record through `record.py`: the book in force, the engine's daily values and
   statistics, the diagnostics, and a flag for each diagnostic outside the band the book's
   section of `BITACORA.md` registered before its first day, each failed check and each
   restatement.
6. Exits 0 when clean, 1 when a flag was raised, 2 when a step failed, so a scheduler can tell.

Configured in `Config/.env`: `PAPER_TRADING_INPUT` (`provider` or `database`),
`PAPER_TRADING_SINKS` (`local`, `database` or both), `PAPER_TRADING_DATABASE` and
`PAPER_TRADING_PUBLISH_DATA`; each has a flag that overrides it for one run.  `SETUP.md` says how
to schedule it.

Every performance figure it writes comes from the engine.  See `BITACORA.md` for the gate a book
passes to get here.
