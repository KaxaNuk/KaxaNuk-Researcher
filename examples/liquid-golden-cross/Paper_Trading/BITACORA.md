# Paper Trading — step 7 of 8

The last step inside the Investment Lab, and the only one that runs on data the strategy has never
seen.

**In plain words:** a dress rehearsal on data nobody has seen yet. **It produces** out-of-sample
evidence and an operations checklist. **It prevents** finding the plumbing problems on day one of
funding.

A backtest tells you what a rule *would* have done; paper trading tells you what it *does* — on live
prices, with live universe changes, and with the delistings and corporate actions a historical file
has already tidied up.

Step 8, Production, is not here: a strategy leaves this repository when it is funded — real
capital, real monitoring, a real drawdown policy, step 8 of the KaxaNuk Strategy Template — and
where that is depends on whose desk it is.

## What graduation means

An experiment is **promoted**, not copied. `Paper_Trading/Paper_Trading_N/` mirrors the
`Experiment_N` it came from, so the lineage of a paper-traded book is never in question. The
experiment notebook stays where it is — it remains the record of how the rule was chosen.

## The gate

Strong backtest results are necessary and **not sufficient**. All five must hold.

| # | Criterion | Why it is on the list |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Beats the benchmarks on risk-adjusted return** — above every benchmark it reports against, *and* above its own control row, over the same window | A strategy that only beats the index on raw return is usually just carrying more risk |
| 2 | **Attribution shows idiosyncratic alpha in both layers** — selection in the Brinson-Fachler cut, a residual the factor model cannot explain, and a selection story that survives the third pass on residual returns | If the return decomposes entirely into known factors, the honest product is a cheaper factor fund, not this |
| 3 | **Conclusions survive parameter perturbation, and the trial count is published beside the winner** | A result that appears at one threshold and vanishes at the next is a sweep artefact. Read the direction across a sweep, never the single best cell. Publishing N is the minimum — the five ways a backtest lies in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), row 3 — and the sign-off states whether the deflated figure was also computed |
| 4 | **Costs and capacity are modelled and stated** — turnover, commission, and any assumption the engine does *not* model, borrow cost above all | The gap between a backtest and a fill is where strategies die |
| 5 | **Explicit sign-off** | Graduation is a decision, not a threshold that trips automatically |

Every criterion is evidenced from the experiment's `FINDINGS_N.md` and from
[`../RESULTS.md`](../RESULTS.md). **If it cannot be evidenced from those, it has not been met.**

### Criterion 2 is evaluable here, and that is not universal

This stack has a real attribution stage, so "is this selection, or a factor tilt?" is a question
with an answer rather than an admission. Repositories built on stacks without step 6 have to
substitute a beta-matched control book or an explicit regression on the market, and name the
substitute in the sign-off. **Here there is no substitute to name, which means there is also no
excuse.**

Expect a *pass with a qualification* rather than a clean pass. A book whose excess return is roughly
half factor exposure and half idiosyncratic has passed criterion 2 and has also been told exactly
how much of it is not the idea — which is what the criterion exists to surface, not a reason to
soften it.

## What a paper-trading run is

Unlike an experiment, this stage is **not** a notebook. It is a script that can be run on a
schedule, because the question is no longer "what would this have done" but "what does it hold
today, and how is it doing":

- reads the same refined panel the experiment did, refreshed;
- applies the graduated rule with **no re-fitting** — the parameters are frozen at graduation;
- writes the target book for the date, and appends to a running performance record;
- flags divergence from the backtest's expected behaviour: turnover, holdings count, exposure.

`daily_update.py` is the scheduler over every graduated book; `Paper_Trading_1/paper_trading_1.py`
is one graduated rule, frozen. Both carry their contract as a docstring and **no logic**: nothing
has graduated yet, and agreeing what the stage may and may not do is worth more than code written
before there is a book to run.

One rule in that contract is worth repeating, because it is the whole point of the stage: **a
paper-trading script re-fits nothing.** A run that tunes anything is a backtest wearing a costume,
and it re-introduces exactly the search that produces negative out-of-sample performance.

## Current status

**Nothing has graduated. Nothing has been tested.** This is the template; the first candidate
arrives when an experiment's `FINDINGS_N.md` can evidence criterion 1.

When one does, record it here: which experiment, which variant, which criteria it clears, and —
above all — which it does not and why. **The blocking items are the content of this section, not the
passing ones.**

**`Paper_Trading_1/` is named for the experiment it would mirror.** Experiment 1 is the benchmark,
so its graduation is not applicable and this folder is renamed for the experiment that actually
graduates. The convention is right; the number is a placeholder until then.

### In this example: the gate run once, and the answer is no

**`liquid-golden-cross` does not graduate, and it was never going to** — Experiment 1 is the
declared benchmark, and a benchmark's job is to be a fair yardstick, not a candidate. It is
evaluated here anyway, because a gate nobody has ever run against a real book is a gate nobody
knows how to apply. Every row is evidenced from
[`../Experiments/Experiment_1/FINDINGS_1.md`](../Experiments/Experiment_1/FINDINGS_1.md).

| # | Criterion | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Beats the benchmarks **and its own control** | **Fails.** Sharpe 0.861 beats the index's 0.774 and its own control's 0.813 — but the control earns **1.12 points a year more** once it is put on the same rebalance dates, and the criterion is about risk-adjusted return over the same window. It passes on Sharpe and only on Sharpe, which is precisely the kind of single-metric pass this gate exists to catch |
| 2 | Idiosyncratic alpha in **both** layers | **Partly, and now measured rather than asserted.** The factor model leaves 45.5 points of 159.5 unexplained — but random books of the same shape earn about 12.5, so roughly 33 points are genuine, and of those only about 5 belong to the signal the strategy is named after. The first cut is per asset in this library, so its selection number is not the group-level story the criterion asks for, and the third pass on residual returns has not been run |
| 3 | Survives perturbation; trial count published | **Fails.** Four variants, all published — but no parameter was perturbed. The 50/200 pair, the 30 names, the 10% band and the 63-day window are all single settings, and none has been read as a curve |
| 4 | Costs and capacity modelled and stated | **Partly.** Costs are modelled, charged on the unadjusted price, and reported net, with a realistic-commission row beside the frozen one. **Capacity is not modelled at all**, though the liquidity ranking makes this the book least likely to be constrained by it |
| 5 | Explicit sign-off | **Not sought.** Criteria 1 and 3 block it |

**What the exercise is worth teaching.** The book beats its index on every headline number a
pitch deck would show, and still fails the gate on the first criterion. That gap — between *beats
the index* and *beats the thing it is actually a variant of* — is the whole reason criterion 1
names the control, and it is the one finding of Experiment 1 that generalises.
