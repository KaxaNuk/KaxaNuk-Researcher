# Bibliotheca — the index

**Step 1 of the KaxaNuk Strategy Template.** Nothing here is a strategy; everything here is a reason a
strategy is shaped the way it is. [`../OBJECTIVE.md`](../OBJECTIVE.md) states what we believe, and
this folder is where those beliefs are supposed to come from.

**In plain words:** the literature that argues with the claims in `OBJECTIVE.md`, read after they
are written. **It produces** a referenced hypothesis, in the repo, dated. **It prevents**
backtesting a hunch you cannot defend afterwards.

## How this folder works

```

**A folder appears when its first note does.** Nothing empty is committed here, so `Books/` and any
`Notes/` you want are directories you create on the day you have something to put in them. The shape
above is the convention, not a skeleton to keep swept.

**A source listed without a note is a *lead*, not a citation.** It is here because somebody thought
it would answer a question this repository has. Nothing may be claimed on its authority until it has
been read and a note written.

**PDFs are gitignored.** They sit beside the notes on disk; only the notes are committed — which is
right twice over: no binaries in the tree, and no redistribution of licensed material. **Do not
download papers, books or datasets without asking.** Links go here; files arrive on request.

## What a note looks like

Every note opens with the same four fields as YAML frontmatter — `source` (where it lives outside
this repository — a DOI, a URL, a publisher; never invented), `citation` (with the date the link was
last checked), `local_copy` (the PDF beside the note, by path, gitignored — or `none`) and `read`
(the date it was read into this repository, and what was read — the whole paper, or the chapters).
A fifth, `tags`, is optional; a researcher's home library uses it. Frontmatter because a tool can
index it: the Investment Lab will read these fields, and the links between notes, to show what
cites what.

| Note | Body |
| --- | --- |
| **Paper** | a first line saying what was read; `## Why it is here`, naming the claim in `OBJECTIVE.md` by number; then *what it says* — one heading per claim, in the authors' terms — and under each, *what it implies for this strategy*, as a blockquote; last, `## What it changes`: three to seven bullets against that claim, and one line on what it does not settle |
| **Book** | a folder. `INDEX.md` holds the distillation table — every chapter, its pages, its status (*read*, *skimmed*, *skipped*, *to come*), the claim it serves, the link to its note — and *what this book does not settle for us*; then one file per chapter read, in the paper's shape. Nothing is written for a chapter nobody chose |

Four rules separate a note from a summary:

1. **The implication is a blockquote, always.** It is the only part that is *ours*, and it has to be
   visually separable from what the source said.
2. **A heading states the source's claim, never our verdict.** Our verdict lives in the blockquote,
   where it can change when a result moves; a heading carrying a verdict rots silently.
3. **Record contradictions as contradictions.** When a source says to do the opposite of what we do,
   that stays visible rather than being smoothed into agreement. When a later note contradicts an
   earlier one, the older claim stays and gets a `> [!WARNING]` callout above it naming the newer
   note by link. It is usually the most useful line in the note.
4. **Never invent a URL or a page number.** A missing link is recorded as a task, because a gap
   phrased as a task gets closed and one phrased as a fact does not. A wrong citation is worse than
   none.

**A note that does not say what it changes about this strategy is a summary, and summaries are
available elsewhere.**

## How a researcher uses this folder

A researcher — a person, or yours, made with `init-researcher` from the
[KaxaNuk Researcher](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher) —
reads these notes to fine-tune the claims in [`../OBJECTIVE.md`](../OBJECTIVE.md), which were
written before any of them, and to draft the thesis and predictions in each `BLUEPRINT_N.md`.
**Every prediction it writes cites the note it came from**, and a source without a note cannot be
cited: it is a lead, and the note is written first. That is what makes the hypothesis defensible
afterwards — each line of it points back to something somebody read.

Yours writes the notes with `read`: a script pulls the table of contents out of the PDF, the
researcher shows it to you and asks which chapters serve which claim, reads only those, and writes
one note per chapter, its row in this file and a line in `LOG.md` — after a plan and your go. A note
its home library already holds comes across without re-reading the PDF; only the implications are
written anew, for this strategy's claims.

> **Read a source because you have a question, not because it is a good source.** Part 1 starts
> empty and fills as *your* idea raises questions. Parts 2 to 5 are seeded with the standard reading
> behind the later steps — leads, none of them read yet.

## Part 0 — Where this process comes from

Investment research did not evolve by replacement; it evolved by addition. Each step and each
control of this process is an answer to a question the field asked, in roughly this order. The table
is provenance rather than reading notes: none of these rows is a note, and none needs to be, because
what they changed is the process itself.

| The question | Who answered it | What it settled | Where it lives here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What do prices carry? | Dow, Bachelier, Nelson (1889–1903) | prices embed collective information; uncertainty is modelled probabilistically | the premise that a rule struck on prices can carry information at all |
| Is there value apart from price? | Graham & Dodd (1934), Damodaran (1994) | valuation is a model with explicit assumptions, not a number | `BLUEPRINT_N.md`: state the mechanism before the test |
| How is capital allocated across many bets? | Markowitz (1952) | risk lives in covariance; portfolios over assets | step 4, and the Portfolio Construction module |
| Which risk is rewarded? | Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) | beta earns a premium — **performance attribution is born** | step 6's first cut: market exposure against everything else |
| What is skill, measurably? | Jensen (1968) | alpha is the residual after the risk adjustment; measurement precedes belief | graduation criterion 2 asks for **idiosyncratic** alpha |
| Must alpha be proven? | Fama (1970) | alpha is rare; evidence beats intuition | the bar in `AGENTS.md`, and *the five ways a backtest lies* |
| How many risks are there? | Ross (1976) | multiple priced factors, even when unnamed | why step 6 uses a multi-factor model, not a single beta |
| Which factors, empirically? | Fama & French (1992, 1993), Carhart (1997) | value, size, momentum; research becomes systematic | the factor sets step 6 reads |
| Why do inefficiencies survive? | Kahneman & Tversky (1979), Shiller (1981) | loss aversion, bias, asymmetric preferences | the economic-reason clause: a mechanism, not a pattern |
| Why is being right not enough? | Shleifer & Vishny (1997) | arbitrage is costly and capital-constrained | costs and capacity as a gate criterion; results accepted net |
| What framework survives both? | Lo (2004) | markets adapt; strategies have life cycles; regimes matter | step 7 exists because alpha decays; one-regime caveats in every findings file |
| What does durable research look like? | Asness (1997), Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013) | factors persist but cycle; robustness beats intuition | sweeps read as curves; rejected results reported as loudly as promising ones |
| What is actually yours? | Paleologo (2021) | **alpha is what remains after risk is removed** | step 6 and the alpha decomposition |
| Who finds clean signals faster? | Dixon, Halperin & Bilokon (2020) | learning replaces assumptions about the data-generating process | outside this process today; a stage that learns still passes the same gate |
| How should research be designed? | Guo, Wang, Ni & Shum (2022) | research is a system, not a model | the process itself: discretionary at design, systematic at scale |

## Part 1 — The core idea

The evidence under the claims in `OBJECTIVE.md` themselves — **including the sources that argue
against them**. This is the part of the bibliography that should argue with you, and it stays empty
until your strategy has a question of its own.

<!-- example: begin -->

| Source | What it bears on |
| --- | --- |
| Paleologo (2021) — *Advanced Portfolio Management* | why a trend rule is not a momentum rule, claim 1; and **against claim 2**, when a signal's strength should set the size and how to measure whether it does. Chapters 5, 6 and 8 read, from Luna's library: [note](Books/Paleologo_2021_Advanced_Portfolio_Management/INDEX.md) |
| Sullivan, Timmermann & White (1999) — *Data-Snooping, Technical Trading Rule Performance, and the Bootstrap* | **the argument against claim 1.** Moving-average rules survive the data-snooping adjustment in 1897–1986 and not in 1987–1996; a one-day implementation lag removes most of the return. Read whole: [note](Papers/Sullivan_Timmermann_White_1999_Data_Snooping.md) |
| LeBaron (1999) — *The Stability of Moving Average Technical Trading Rules on the Dow Jones Index* | claim 1, from one of the authors of the 1992 study: the buy-sell difference reverses after 1986 while the volatility difference holds. Read whole: [note](Papers/LeBaron_1999_The_Stability_Of_Moving_Average_Rules.md) |
| Baltussen, Dom, Van Vliet & Vidojevic (2025) — *Momentum factor investing: Evidence and evolution* | claim 1, the context the objective's *not that this is momentum* line rests on: the factor is a relative rank throughout, it did not decay after publication where the rule's precedent did, and an own-price-path condition — nearness to the 52-week high — earns nothing once its momentum loading is removed. What the book's +12.75 momentum points are, and are not. Read whole: [note](Papers/Baltussen_Dom_VanVliet_Vidojevic_2025_Momentum_Factor_Investing.md) |
| Brock, Lakonishok & LeBaron (1992) — *Simple Technical Trading Rules and the Stochastic Properties of Stock Returns* | claim 1, the support: the study this idea inherits, which Sullivan, Timmermann & White and LeBaron both re-examine. Both copies found are image scans with no text layer, so nothing is claimed on it. *No note yet.* |
| Amihud (2002) — *Illiquidity and Stock Returns: Cross-Section and Time-Series Effects* | **against claim 3**: less traded stocks earn more. *No note yet.* |
| Lee & Swaminathan (2000) — *Price Momentum and Trading Volume* | **against claim 3**: heavily traded stocks earn less and their past winners reverse sooner — the closest source to this pairing of volume and trend. *No note yet.* |
| Korajczyk & Sadka (2004) — *Are Momentum Profits Robust to Trading Costs?* | claim 3, for it on costs: liquidity-aware construction holding up after costs. *No note yet.* |
| Sarkar, Du & Vafai (2019) — *Impacts of Sector and Company Size on Effective Factor Investing: Evidence from U.S. Equity Market* | claim 3, what a book of the largest companies loads on: momentum significant in the large-cap portfolio, with a negative coefficient the text never discusses; size and value not, once sectors are in; beta largely explained by the rate terms and the sectors. Bears on open lead 3, the sector factors reading zero. Read whole: [note](Papers/Sarkar_Du_Vafai_2019_Impacts_Of_Sector_And_Company_Size.md) |
| Grinold & Kahn (n.d.) — *Active Portfolio Management*, chapters 13, 14 and 16 | claim 4: a no-trade band as wide as the costs of buying and selling, keeping most of the value added at half the turnover (14 and 16); **against it**, a delayed trade loses a signal's value at the rate of its half-life, and a band is a delay (13). Chapter 14 read for claim 2 as well. All three read, from Luna's library, whose copy prints no year: [note](Books/Grinold_Kahn_ND_Active_Portfolio_Management/INDEX.md) |
| Shu, Yu & Mulvey (2024) — *Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals* | what is not claimed — that the filter protects in every fall: one slow index-or-cash rule that avoided 2020's fall and gave up its rebound. *No note yet.* |

## Part 2 — Universe and data: what is investable, and what the data does to you

*Sources about the inputs rather than the idea. Add whatever your instrument type demands — an ETF
book owes a reading on premium and discount to net asset value, a crypto book one on exchange
idiosyncrasy, a futures book one on roll.*

| Source | What it bears on |
| --- | --- |
| Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson & Ross (1992) — *Survivorship Bias in Performance Studies* | why the seed must retain delisted names. *No note yet.* |
| Shumway (1997) — *The Delisting Bias in CRSP Data* | why the last day of a delisted name is an open gap here. *No note yet.* |

## Part 3 — Portfolio construction and sizing

*How the book is built once the selection is made — step 4. Seeded with the standard reading; none
of it has a note, so none of it may be claimed on yet.*

| Source | What it bears on |
| --- | --- |
| Markowitz (1952) — *Portfolio Selection* | mean-variance optimisation, and the origin of the idea that risk lives in covariance. *No note yet.* |
| DeMiguel, Garlappi & Uppal (2009) — *Optimal Versus Naive Diversification* | **the control every construction variant has to beat.** Equal weighting is not a straw man, and on a narrow universe it is hard to beat out of sample. *No note yet.* |
| Ledoit & Wolf (2004) — *Honey, I Shrunk the Sample Covariance Matrix* | a covariance estimated from daily data over few securities is mostly noise; this is the standard repair. *No note yet.* |
| López de Prado (2016) — *Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out of Sample* | hierarchical risk parity — one of the alternatives the Portfolio Construction module offers. *No note yet.* |
| Moreira & Muir (2017) — *Volatility-Managed Portfolios* | scaling exposure by recent volatility. **The cheap rival to any risk-aware strategy.** *No note yet.* |

## Part 4 — Backtest and attribution

*What a result has to survive, and how the return gets taken apart — steps 5 and 6.*

| Source | What it bears on |
| --- | --- |
| Brinson & Fachler (1985) — *Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance* | the allocation / selection / interaction split step 6 runs under this name. *No note yet.* |
| Brinson, Hood & Beebower (1986) — *Determinants of Portfolio Performance* | the companion, and the origin of the claim that allocation dominates selection. *No note yet.* |
| Novy-Marx & Velikov (2016) — *A Taxonomy of Anomalies and Their Trading Costs* | why results are accepted net only. *No note yet.* |
| Harvey & Liu (2015) — *Backtesting* | how much to haircut a reported Sharpe for the search that produced it. *No note yet.* |

## Part 5 — Research integrity: what stops us fooling ourselves

One source per control claimed in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), *the five ways a backtest lies*.
These are not optional reading: each corresponds to something the process actually does, or admits
it does not.

| Source | The control it stands behind |
| --- | --- |
| Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson & Ross (1992) | the point-in-time universe retains delisted names. *No note yet.* |
| Shumway (1997) | **a gap, not a control.** The final day of a delisted name is unaudited. *No note yet.* |
| Sullivan, Timmermann & White (1999) — *Data-Snooping, Technical Trading Rule Performance, and the Bootstrap* | any rule that was searched for rather than stated first — and the finding that the search is run by the whole investment community, not by one researcher: [note](Papers/Sullivan_Timmermann_White_1999_Data_Snooping.md) |
| Harvey, Liu & Zhu (2016) — *… and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns* | the information-coefficient table screens, it does not prove; publish the trial count. *No note yet.* |
| Bailey & López de Prado (2014) — *The Deflated Sharpe Ratio* | the best of N variants is the maximum of N draws. *No note yet.* |
| Bailey, Borwein, López de Prado & Zhu (2014) — *Pseudo-Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism* | the argument for step 7 existing at all, and for freezing parameters at graduation. *No note yet.* |
| Novy-Marx & Velikov (2016) | results are accepted **net** only. *No note yet.* |

**One control has no paper behind it: look-ahead.** The point-in-time discipline — decide on
yesterday's information, trade at the next available price, name every `current_*` column for what
it is — is practitioner discipline rather than a literature, and this index says so instead of
citing a weak fit. **The cheapest evidence is your own**: if your signal is fitted, read the same
model causally and smoothed and report the gap. That measurement is worth more here than a citation.
