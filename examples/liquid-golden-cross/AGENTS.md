# Agents — how work is done here

The
[template's README](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher/blob/main/templates/strategy/README.md)
says what this process **is** and where each kind of logic goes; read it first. This file says
**how work is done**: who writes each document, the restrictions, and the bar a result has to
survive before anyone believes it.

<!-- example: begin -->

> **Status: steps 1 to 6 run end to end, and step 7's gate evaluated against the result.** The rule
> beats the index by 3.1 points a year and loses to its own control by 1.1; of its 45.5
> idiosyncratic points, about 5 belong to the signal it is named after. It is **not a defensive
> book** — beta 1.028, and more volatile than the index — and what it buys is a drawdown 9.3 points
> shallower than the same thirty names unfiltered. Every number is in `RESULTS.md`. **It does not
> pass the gate, no paper trading has run, and nothing here is out of sample.**
> Replace this line as the strategy moves, and the banner at the top of the README with it.

## First run — for the agent, before anything else

**If `.venv/` is missing, this repository has not been set up.** Say so, and offer to follow
[`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md): the commands in it, every one of them run in the repository root, never a
level above it. A missing `apm_modules/` is expected: the skills are installed once for the user,
and nothing is installed here. Do not start research work in a folder that has not been set up, and
never create a folder around this one — `SETUP.md` says what that failure looks like.

Three rules from `SETUP.md` apply from the first command:

- **Never open, read back, print or echo `Config/.env`**, and never put a value from it into a
  command that gets recorded. You may say which keys are still empty, **by name only**.
- **Install no skills here.** They are installed once for the user, with `apm install -g`, as
  *step 4* of `SETUP.md` says, and `apm update -g` keeps them current for every strategy.
- **Skills are discoverable in a new session**, not the one in which they were installed. Say so
  rather than claiming they are already active.

## How work reaches `main`

| Branch | What it is | Cut from | Merges into |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | the accepted work: on the template, the process with no strategy in it; in a strategy repository, that strategy's finished work | — | — |
| `issues/<number>` | one per issue on your repository's GitHub Project. Where all work happens | `main` | `main` |

<!-- example: begin -->

**On this branch.** `liquid-golden-cross` advances here: its work lands on `example`, directly or
from a branch cut from it, never in a pull request into `main`, and `BLUEPRINT_1.md` is still
committed before the rule. `main` is never merged into `example`; process changes come across file
by file. A strategy of your own starts from `main` and stays in your own repository.

<!-- example: end -->

Use `issues/27-B` and `issues/27-C` when one issue needs a second attempt or splits into parallel
lines of work: same issue, same discussion, separate history.

**The template and the example live in the
[KaxaNuk Researcher](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher)** package,
`KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher`: the template as `templates/strategy/`, and one strategy,
`liquid-golden-cross`, worked through it as `examples/liquid-golden-cross/` — its own lines between
example markers, for reading and copying, never building on. When the process changes, the example
takes the change file by file. The files inside the folders live only in the example; the shape is
written down once, in the *What is in here* table of the template's README, which a strategy's own
README links to. Issues and pull requests from anyone land there — the process improves in public.
A strategy of your own stays in your own repository.

**`init-strategy` copies the template only**, on purpose. `Bibliotheca/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` and
`LOG.md` come with it, empty. A strategy takes the other files it needs from the example with
`init-example <path>`, one path at a time, and deletes what is the worked strategy's — everything
between the example markers, and the seed — or lets the `experiment-lifecycle` skill scaffold them.
**The issue branches below are a recommendation**, there to keep project management simple, not a
gate.

### The issue exists before the branch

An idea goes on the **GitHub Project** first. The issue is where the *why* lives; the branch is only
where the *what* happens. A branch with no issue is work whose reasoning cannot be reviewed, and in
this repository the reasoning is the product.

```
idea  ->  issue on the Project board  ->  issues/<number> cut from main  ->  PR into main
```

1. **Open the issue.** State the question, not the solution.
2. **Cut the branch** — `git switch -c issues/<number> main`.
3. **For an experiment, `BLUEPRINT_N.md` is the first commit on that branch**, before the rule; for
   Experiment 1 only the `BRAINSTORMING_1.md` entry choosing the benchmark comes before it. The
   branch makes it visible in the diff that the hypothesis was written before the answer.
4. **Work**, committing against the issue.
5. **PR into `main`**, once the pipeline has been re-run end to end from a wiped working copy.

### Before any pull request

- `uvx ruff check .` passes, notebooks included.
- **Notebook outputs are stripped.** The committed notebook is the method; `FINDINGS_N.md` is the
  record.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` entry is part of the change-set, not a follow-up. If you cannot write the
  entry, the change-set is not finished.
- **If a published number moved, the PR says which** — and `FINDINGS_N.md` changed before
  `RESULTS.md`, never the other way round.

**`main` is not where you work.** It is where work arrives.

## Who writes each document, and when it changes

| Document | Who writes it | Changes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OBJECTIVE.md` | a person, first | almost never — a change here means a *different* strategy |
| the notes in `Bibliotheca/` | a person, or a researcher made with `init-researcher` from the [KaxaNuk Researcher](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher), with its `read` skill — one per paper, one per chapter of a book somebody chose, after a plan and a go | a source is read. A later note corrects an earlier one with a callout above the claim, never by smoothing it away |
| `Bibliotheca/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` | a person adds the leads; whoever writes a note adds its row | a source is added, or read |
| `RESULTS.md` | the AI, from the findings files | a `FINDINGS_N.md` changes |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | whoever lands a change-set | any change-set lands |
| `AGENTS.md` | anyone | the process changes |
| `BLUEPRINT_N.md` | a person, or with the AI | **never, once written.** A hypothesis edited after its test is not a hypothesis |
| `BRAINSTORMING_N.md` | a person, or with the AI | thinking happens — **before** the work |
| `JOURNAL_N.md` | the AI, as work proceeds | append only. Earlier entries are corrected by new entries, never edited |
| `FINDINGS_N.md` | the AI, from the journal | a result changes. It is rewritten, so there is exactly one current answer |

**`RESULTS.md` is compiled from the findings files and cites each one.** When a number changes,
change it in `FINDINGS_N.md` first — a summary that leads its sources is how two numbers for the
same book start to circulate. **One deliberate exception:** findings from step 3 go straight into
`RESULTS.md`, because notebook outputs are stripped before committing and a measurement living only
in a cell output does not survive the commit.

Repository-level history — the benchmark once `BRAINSTORMING_1.md` has chosen it, the data step,
the architecture — belongs in `JOURNAL_1.md`. Experiment 1 is the declared benchmark and therefore
the shared context; later journals point there rather than copying it.

# Restrictions

## One experiment at a time

**When working on `Experiment_N`, do not open another experiment's files** to decide what this one
should do. Each experiment stands on its own hypothesis. Reading another's answers first is how a
parameter tuned on one book quietly becomes the default of the next, and how three experiments
become one experiment reported three times.

Two standing exceptions, and one that has to be asked for:

- **Experiment 1 is the declared benchmark**, so its rules and published numbers are shared
  context. It is not a null: it is a real strategy with a real return. **Its rules freeze once
  `FINDINGS_1.md` reports** — a change invalidates every comparison in `RESULTS.md`, so
  improvements go into a new experiment.
- **`RESULTS.md` is the shared record.** Comparing *final* results across experiments is the whole
  point of having several. What is forbidden is borrowing another experiment's *choices* before your
  own are made.
- **A researcher may lift this, explicitly.** When one experiment needs to read another — to reuse
  a loader, to check a data fix, to build a control arm that differs in exactly one thing — the
  request and the reason go in that experiment's `JOURNAL_N.md` first. A look-across that is
  written down is a decision; one that is not is contamination.

## The bar any new signal must clear

1. **State the economic reason before running.** A result that arrives before a hypothesis is an
   observation, not evidence.
2. **Read sweeps as curves, not cells.** A parameter degrading monotonically across three settings
   is information; a variant beating its control by 0.001 Sharpe is not.
3. **Count the trials and publish the count.** A reader cannot discount a best-of-N result without
   knowing N.
4. **Accept results net, or not at all.** On a high-turnover book, the difference between a flat
   cost model and real per-share commission can be a third of the winning edge.
5. **Attribute before believing.** A strategy that beats its benchmark has not been understood until
   attribution says which part is factor exposure and which part is selection. This stack can do it,
   so "we could not tell" is not an available answer.
6. **Never choose a parameter on the metric it will be judged by.** Choose it on a property of the
   *signal* — persistence, coverage, turnover — and publish the sweep.
7. **Prefer the feature anyone can explain in a sentence.** Complexity is added one lever at a time,
   and each addition must beat the simpler baseline to earn its place.
8. **Report the rejected result as loudly as the promising one.** A negative result costs real work
   and stops the next person repeating it.

## Other standing rules

- **Every performance figure comes from the KaxaNuk Backtest Engine.** There is deliberately no
  second, lighter simulator: one that disagrees just lets the reader pick the number they prefer.
- **Do not change a committed result to make it agree with a new run.** If the numbers moved, find
  out why first, and record it.
- **Do not quietly drop a bad run.** A run that cannot be believed is excluded **by name**, with its
  reason, in `RESULTS.md`.
- **Do not commit binaries or notebook outputs.** No charts, no engine workbooks, no PDFs.
- **Do not put logic in a file that cannot be traced to a stage.** If a reader cannot tell which
  step owns a file, it does not belong here, however correct it is.
- **Do not touch Production.** Step 8 is not in this repository and nothing here deploys.
- **Never print a value from `Config/.env`** — not into a commit, a notebook output, a log line, or
  a command that gets recorded. An exposed key is rotated, not edited out.
- **Never use the section symbol** in documents here. Write "section" or name the heading.
- **In the example, mark the worked strategy's content as you add it.**
  `# --- example: begin ---` in Python, an HTML comment of the same words in Markdown, and
  `# EXAMPLE-ONLY CELL` on a whole notebook cell. Nothing consumes these; they show a person
  starting their own strategy what to delete.

# Research integrity — the five ways a backtest lies

The part of the process that has nothing to do with Python.

| # | The lie | What the process does | What it still does not do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Survivorship bias.** A universe built from *today's* members has deleted everything that failed, and the backtest discovers that markets go up | the seed is point-in-time and **retains delisted names**; step 2 quantifies how much of the universe is dead | audit the *last day* of a delisted name. The missing delisting returns are disproportionately the bad ones |
| 2 | **Look-ahead.** A signal computed from information that did not exist yet always works | every rule is struck on **shifted** data and fills at the next available price; a fitted signal is used in its causal form, and the smoothed form only where it is labelled as not tradable | remove the one stated leak: a delisting exit needs one day of hindsight, because a position is sold on the last day it still has a fill price |
| 3 | **Overfitting.** Try enough rules and one looks brilliant. The Sharpe of the best of *N* trials is the maximum of *N* draws | economic reason first, sweeps read as curves, parameters never chosen on the metric they are judged by, **the trial count published beside the winner** | compute the deflated figure. Publishing the count is the minimum, not the answer |
| 4 | **Costs and capacity.** A backtest with no costs describes a market that does not exist | commission on the **unadjusted** price, integer share counts, a cash reserve, turnover reported, results accepted **net** | model capacity, anywhere. Borrow cost, short rebate and margin are a headline caveat on any long/short book, not a footnote |
| 5 | **Dirty data presented as a finding.** An unadjusted split, a stale price, a reused identifier — each produces a plausible number and no error | coverage checked before conclusions; a truncated engine run is flagged and the variant excluded **by name** | catch what nobody thought to check. The instructive case was a run that stopped valuing a book partway and still summarised cleanly over the stub |

**The one deliberate look-ahead is named in its own column prefix.** A `current_*` column comes from
today's security master, so any period before a reclassification is misattributed. That is why the
prefix exists, why anything bucketed on it is read as indicative, and why no rule selects on one.

**If your signal is fitted, measure what look-ahead costs.** Read the same model causally and
smoothed and report the gap. It is the cheapest audit in the process and routinely the largest
number in it: the two series agree on most days and differ exactly at the turning points, which is
where the money is.

## What attribution must report

Savvy investors do not chase past performance. They follow a **process**, an **investing thesis**
and **data**, and attribution is what gives them all three about a book. Step 6 runs two
methodologies and a third pass, and `FINDINGS_N.md` reports each.

**First cut — Brinson-Fachler.** Active return split into **allocation** (did the book overweight
the right groups) and **selection** (did it pick the right names inside them), plus their
interaction. No more hand-waving about "the process worked": the exact lever that moved the needle
is named, and that is a process you can defend, refine or fix.

**Second layer — the factor model.** Realised return projected onto systematic exposures — beta,
momentum, residual volatility, liquidity — so **idiosyncratic alpha** is separated from
**compensated factor tilts**, taken on purpose or by accident. A book that looks like skilful
stock-picking in the first cut can turn out to be a persistent low-beta or momentum tilt that
happened to pay over the sample.

**Third pass — Brinson-Fachler again, on what is left.** Run the first cut on the residual after
factor exposure is stripped out. The selection story gets sharper, and it answers the question the
first cut alone cannot: **whether the Sharpe survives once that factor turns.**

**What it settles:** whether there is genuine idiosyncratic alpha — criterion 2 of the graduation
gate that `Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` defines, evaluated, not deferred. For a strategy raising
outside money it is also the plainest signal of sophistication: allocators are not buying returns,
they are buying proof you know where the returns come from, and showing both layers cleanly is how
that proof is given.

**What to expect it not to settle:** an *absolute* rule is close to invisible to a factor model
built on *relative* factors, so a book can beat every benchmark while the model assigns roughly
nothing to the factor its thesis is named after. That is a finding, not a failure. The follow-ups
are counterfactual books the engine can already price: the same holdings with the signal switched
off, positions equalised within each date, a random draw from the eligible pool at the same sizes,
and the same holdings with entry dates shifted. Those four separate the exclusion filter, sizing
skill, selection skill and timing skill.

# Code style

PEP 8 plus a stricter house layer, shared across KaxaNuk repositories and installed by APM rather
than committed here. One-line summary: *optimise for the reader who has never seen this file.*

- **No import aliases**, and **no abbreviations** — no variable name under three characters.
- **No nested functions, ever.**
- **One item per line** in any comma-separated construct holding two or more items.
- **Type hints everywhere**; quoted annotations rather than a `__future__` import.
- **Assign the error message to `msg` before raising it**, and leave blank lines around
  `return` / `raise` / `yield`.
- **Docstrings are prose, not sections**, and never repeat what the type hints already say. Say
  *why*.

What is committed is the style check, and the whole repository passes it. Nothing checks the process
itself; the rules above rest on review.

uvx ruff check .
