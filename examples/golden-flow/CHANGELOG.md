# Changelog

Every notable change to this repository, newest first. The format is
`## X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` with `### Added / Changed / Deprecated / Fixed / Removed`, and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in its numbering.

## What a version number means here

This is a research repository, not a library, so there is no public API to version. What the team
depends on is **the results and the pipeline that produces them**, so that is what the number
tracks:

| Bump | Means | Triggered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAJOR** | **Published results are invalidated.** Anything quoted from an earlier version has to be re-derived before it can be repeated | Changing the universe, the date window, the backtest engine or its cost model, or the definition of an existing strategy. Removing a stage |
| **MINOR** | **New capability; existing results still stand** | A new experiment, signal, stage, diagnostic or document. Anything additive |
| **PATCH** | **Nothing about any result changes** | Bug fixes in tooling, documentation, repository hygiene, refactors that produce identical output |

Three conventions follow from reading it that way:

- **A result that changes is a MAJOR bump even if the code change was one line.** Severity is
  measured in what a reader has to throw away, not in the size of the diff.
- **Re-running the pipeline on refreshed data is not a version bump at all.** The strategy did not
  change; only the data did. Say so in the entry and leave the number alone.
- **While on `0.x`, a result-invalidating change bumps MINOR** — the standard pre-1.0 convention.

**1.0.0 is reserved** for this strategy's first book on **paper trading** (step 7), its results
reproduced from a clean clone. Until then the leading zero is doing real work: it says the results
are still moving.

## How to write an entry

One entry per change-set, newest at the top. Under the heading, **one sentence saying what a reader
has to do differently** — that is the part people actually read. Then the lists, each item written
for somebody who was not in the room:

- **Say what moved and why, not what file you touched.** "The regime model lives in the Refinery so
  a penalty sweep costs no download" is an entry; "updated custom_calculations.py" is a diff.
- **Name anything that invalidates a number**, and say which number.
- **A removal is a change-set too.** Deleting a stage that nobody could trace is worth an entry.

## 0.16.0 (2026-10-08)

**MINOR** — the example does what its pages say: without the Backtest Engine, or with a licence
that does not validate, the experiment skips step 5 and reaches its Verify, where it stopped on a
`KeyError`. No number moves: the path with the engine is unchanged.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`SETUP.md`**: nothing runs yet, and why; the hand-over names `objective`; *a few minutes*;
  *What you need first* names the assistant and the KaxaNuk Researcher; one allowed check of
  `Config/.env`, names only, and a plain line on opening it; *Paper trading, daily* moves to
  `Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` as *Running it daily*, the cron line with uv's full path and the dry
  run described as it behaves; `daily_update.py` and `.gitignore` point there.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: the `Config/.env` rule gives that one check.
- **Experiment 1 is the first rule**, not *the benchmark*, in `RESULTS.md`, `FINDINGS_1.md` and
  `experiment_1.ipynb`; the notebook's section 5 names `KN_ANALYTICS_PATH`, and its section table
  the benchmark reconciliation. `OBJECTIVE.md` speaks to its owner. The `CHANGELOG.md` head reserves
  1.0.0 for this strategy's first book on paper trading.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: `pandas>=2.3.3,<3` — every published figure ran on pandas 2; the cap lifts
  once the example runs on pandas 3, and a Data Curator that needs 3 lifts it first.

- **The example's own code**: `experiment_1.ipynb` guards every cell that reads the engine's runs
  (`ENGINE_READY`), prints *step 5 skipped* with the reason, runs attribution only after a priced
  rule, and checks the weight files when the engine is absent; `WORKERS` is at most the machine's
  cores; `universe.ipynb` retries a profile up to four times, 30 seconds apart, on HTTP 429 or a
  dropped connection, as `Universe/seed.py` does; `portfolio_construction.py`'s `bounded_book`
  docstring says the score a date is sized on is the prior close's.
- **`README.md`**: three plain sentences under the title, figures copied from `RESULTS.md`; the
  glossary after *How to read it*, with *golden cross* and *seed*, and *the first rule's book*;
  *Run it* starts with the environment and the keys; *What a correct run shows* gives 890 names on
  the committed seed (892 on the record's), each notebook's Verify line and what a fresh download
  can add; the daily run in a copy stops and exits 2. The banners lose *Replace this line*.
- **`SETUP.md`**, marked: the hand-over sends the reader to the README, and *Next* says nothing is
  written here.

## 0.15.7 (2026-10-08)

**PATCH** — the shared lines move as the template's 0.17.0 does; the example's own code is
unchanged, and marked lines say its record predates the split check and the worked-date read-back.
No number moves.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`AGENTS.md`**: *Keys join, or the pipeline stops* — every join between the index's files and
  the book goes through the seed's two keys (#13); *The rule is read back before its blueprint* —
  one plain sentence and one worked date's book, the owner's yes a `JOURNAL_N.md` entry saved before
  the blueprint, so two entries come before Experiment 1's (#15).
- **`Universe/universe.ipynb`**: every register row has a severity, blocking first, a blocking row
  excluded by name; a further check, *traded value broken at a split* (#14); a shortfall is a member
  the provider does not carry, never a listing whose key did not join; Verify, for a seed taken from
  an index, raises on a weighted listing with no seed row, a key used twice, or one ISIN on two rows
  over the same dates (#13); section 1 says an ISIN repeats only where a renamed security's rows
  follow each other in time.
- **`Experiments/Experiment_1/experiment_1.ipynb`**: section 0 reads the exclusions from the
  register's blocking rows, never typed; section 8 raises if the book, the control or any arm holds
  one (#13).
- **`Experiments/Experiment_1/JOURNAL_1.md`**, its preamble, and **`Data/curator.py`**, its
  docstring: the read-back entry (#15); traded value checked across every split (#14).

- **Marked, the example's own**: what the record's code does not do, since the checks came after it
  — its universe register lists its rows as its checks run, not blocking first, and its Verify runs
  no ISIN check (its seed holds no ISIN twice); its experiment Verify asserts the exclusions on the
  book, not on the control and each arm, which come from the same eligible set. And: the universe
  notebook says the split check was added after the record and this copy's run did not perform it;
  `AGENTS.md` says Golden Flow's rule was read back as a sentence, *bounds set the count*, without a
  worked date's book.

## 0.15.6 (2026-10-08)

**PATCH** — the shared `AGENTS.md` and `SETUP.md` lines move as the template's 0.16.0 does. No
number moves.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`AGENTS.md`**, *Other standing rules*: a new Lab library build is a change-set, between
  experiments, never during one — the researcher says when one is out, keeping the date of that
  weekly check in this repository's git config (`kaxanuk.labnext`), never saved; `uv lock
  --upgrade-package <name>`, then `uv sync --group notebook --inexact`, a re-run from a wiped copy
  and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry naming any number that moved; a book on paper runs on the Data Curator
  it was frozen with.
- **`SETUP.md`**, step 2: *A newer Lab library*, the same in three lines.

## 0.15.5 (2026-10-08)

**PATCH** — the shared `Config/.env.template` and `SETUP.md` lines move as the template's 0.15.1
does. No number moves: the record's book was sized by `Experiments/portfolio_construction.py`
itself, without the library, which it does not need.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`Config/.env.template`**: `KNPC_API_KEY_KAXANUK`, Portfolio Construction's licence since its
  2.0.0 — the library reads it from the environment or a `.kaxanuk_license` file, and a driver that
  loads this file into the environment first passes it on.
- **`SETUP.md`** step 3 names it beside the other two licences, and says the library reads it from
  the environment or `.kaxanuk_license`; *Paper trading, daily* says a saved licence check covers 3
  days offline from Backtest Engine 0.67.0 (7 before), the first run on it needing the network.
- **`Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md`**: paper trading is the last step inside this repository, not
  inside the Investment Lab, whose libraries run steps 3 to 6.

## 0.15.4 (2026-10-08)

**PATCH** — the shared lines of `AGENTS.md` and `SETUP.md` move as the template's 0.15.0 does, and
a marked line in `SETUP.md` says an untracked `uv.lock` after `uv sync` is expected here. No number
moves.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`AGENTS.md`**, *The blueprint is committed before the rule*: a document the researcher writes on
  the owner's go — a note, `OBJECTIVE.md`, `BLUEPRINT_N.md`, a `JOURNAL_N.md` entry, a line in
  `Bibliotheca/LOG.md` — is saved as its own version on that go, with no `CHANGELOG.md` entry,
  version bump or ruff gate; the blueprint is saved alone; the go is the owner's signature, on
  which the assistant removes the template's blockquote. *Before any commit to `main`* names those
  saves as the exception.
- **`SETUP.md`**: the paragraph about publishing the repository and the hand-over's line about a
  remote leave — a copy off the computer is made only when the owner asks, with `backup`; the git
  name and e-mail are asked for in plain words.

## 0.15.3 (2026-10-08)

**PATCH** — the shared lines of `SETUP.md` and `AGENTS.md` name APM 0.33.0 and the update in full,
as the template's 0.14.1 does. No number moves.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Changed

- **`SETUP.md`, `AGENTS.md`**: `uvx --from apm-cli==0.33.0 apm install -g` and
  `uvx --from apm-cli==0.33.0 apm update -g`.

## 0.15.2 (2026-10-07)

**PATCH** — the 0.15.1 entry, which records this copy, now lists every figure Golden Flow 0.15.1
corrected. It left out three, which `FINDINGS_1.md` already carried, and `RESULTS.md` and a note
in part; its first line said no number moved; and it said Golden Flow's own sentences, where a
module has them, open its marked code, where each such comment was written for this copy. No
other file changes but `pyproject.toml`'s version, and no number moves. This version line is the
example's own: it counts changes to this copy, which stays Golden Flow 0.15.1's.

**What to do differently:** nothing.

### Fixed

- **The 0.15.1 entry** lists the three figures under *Fixed*, says in its first line that the
  copy carries them, and says the comments opening the marked code were written for this copy.

## 0.15.1 (2026-10-07)

**PATCH** — Golden Flow, copied into the KaxaNuk Researcher as its worked example. The copy moves
no number; it carries three figures Golden Flow 0.15.1 corrected to the record run's outputs,
listed under *Fixed*.

**What to do differently:** nothing to migrate. Copy it with `init-example`; the index and factor
files come from KaxaNuk's Analytics Factory, as `SETUP.md` says.

### Changed

- **The documents are shortened for a reader.** `README.md` says how to read the example and how
  to run it, states its rule, and shows how it uses the KaxaNuk Investment Lab and the Analytics
  Factory. Elsewhere, Golden Flow's lines sit between markers, after the template's guidance they
  answer.
- **`JOURNAL_1.md` starts on 2026-10-05.** It keeps every entry from then on, whole, except the
  2026-10-06 entry that retired the brainstorming file. Private names, a local path and a branch
  name are replaced in square brackets. A dated entry at the end records this copy.
- **Eighteen notes are carried, and five are kept only as leads.** Each carried note keeps *What it
  says* word for word. Its implication is rewritten and dated, after `FINDINGS_1.md` reported.
- **The code is Golden Flow 0.15.1's, with these differences:**
  - each shared module opens with the template's docstring; where its marked code opens with a
    comment, the comment was written for this copy, from what Golden Flow's docstrings and
    records say about the module;
  - each notebook keeps the template's markdown cells, with Golden Flow's paragraphs between
    markers; every code cell is Golden Flow's, starts `# EXAMPLE-ONLY CELL`, and has no outputs;
  - `Data/hand_supplied.py` reads the Analytics Factory's own file names,
    `KN_US_Equity_Benchmark_Holdings.csv` and `KN_US_Equity_Benchmark_Returns.csv`. They are
    byte-identical to the files Golden Flow read under the KN US Equity Core's name: md5
    `eba4bf64ffa8de5d650e4e2c4b21844d` and `1668b564582f1871d7e4a6f39896e50a`;
  - the Analytics Factory is named in place of Golden Flow's older name for it, in comments,
    docstrings and one message, and a line this made longer than 100 columns is rewrapped;
  - `Universe/seed.py` takes `--index-master` as a required argument and names no machine path.
    Its shorter docstring says it overwrites the committed seed, and ships to show how the seed was
    built;
  - `.gitignore`, `Config/.env.template`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`, `CLAUDE.md` and
    `pyproject.toml` are the template's; `pyproject.toml` is named `golden-flow`, at 0.15.1;
  - no `uv.lock` is committed, so the library versions resolve when `uv sync` runs. The recorded
    figures were run on Backtest Engine 0.66.0 and Attribution Analysis 0.2.0.
- **Byte for byte:** the seed, `Universe/Investable_Universe.csv`, and in
  `Paper_Trading/Paper_Trading_1/` the frozen copies and `FREEZE.json`.
- **`Paper_Trading_1` is a record here, not a running book.** Its frozen security master is not
  shipped, and `Data/Curator/custom_calculations.py` and `paper_trading_1.py` no longer match the
  hashes registered for them. `daily_update.py` stops the book, as `Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` says.

### Fixed

Golden Flow 0.15.1's own fixes, which this copy carries:

- **`FINDINGS_1.md` keeps the promises `Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` made before the run.** It
  publishes all twenty random books — each drawing, on the rule's dates, as many index members as
  the rule holds. Each comes with its idiosyncratic return (the part no factor explains), its
  Sharpe and its CAGR (compound yearly return).
- **The sweep is published in full.** Each of its eight perturbed settings sits beside its control,
  with both margins. The golden cross is a 50-day average above the 200-day; a control is the same
  setting without it. Beside the cap rows, how often the cap binds: 620 of 1,408 rebalance dates at
  15%, 341 of 1,381 at 20% and 141 of 1,358 at 25%.
- **The timing arm is stated.** The shifted-entry timing arm was not run, so timing is not
  separated from selection.
- **11.81 years**, in `FINDINGS_1.md` and `RESULTS.md`, is labelled the engine's count: 2,976
  weekday steps after the first day, over 252. The window spans 11.41 calendar years.
- **`OBJECTIVE.md` quotes the owner with "top 35"**, as the journal records it, and then the answer
  that retired the count. The earlier quote had dropped the number without an ellipsis.
- **Three figures, to the record run's own outputs.** The realistic commission row adds 0.43
  points of CAGR, not 0.42: the margin taken before rounding, as every other margin is. The
  members FMP does not price held at most 0.12% of the index's weight in 2022, on its first 37
  trading days, not under 0.1%. The sell-at-t−1 rule changed every first-attempt book but two,
  the rule's and the control's 2023–2026 sub-periods, which came back identical and are read
  from that attempt's cache. The trial count stands at 107.

## 0.15.0 (2026-10-06)

**MINOR** — Experiment 1, on the KN US Equity Core, the Analytics Factory's index of about 600 names
a day. The rule holds the members in a golden cross, ranked and weighted by 63-day traded value,
none above 20% and none below 1%. Measured on 2026-10-06 from a wiped working copy, it compounds at
20.33% a year at a Sharpe of 0.842 over 2015-01-02 to 2026-06-01, net of costs. Its control made
19.73% at 0.763, and the KN US Equity Core 13.05% at 0.713. Nine tenths of the excess return is
factor exposure. The book passed criteria 1 to 4 of the paper-trading gate. The owner signed the
fifth the same day, and it went to paper trading as `Paper_Trading_1`.

**What to do differently:** quote every figure as in sample; `FINDINGS_1.md` sets each beside its
comparison.

### Added

- **`OBJECTIVE.md`**, from the owner's words: the idea and its three claims, the signal, the sizing
  and the construction.
- **`Bibliotheca/`**: the notes behind the claims.
- **The seed**, `Universe/Investable_Universe.csv`: the 896 listings that were KN US Equity Core
  members on some date from 2015-01-02.
- **The data stage**, run on 2026-10-06: 892 names asked of FMP through 2026-10-05, 809
  downloaded and 83 it does not carry; `CY` and `NBL` dropped by the universe notebook, their FMP
  prices contradicting their membership.
- **The drivers, the modules and three notebooks** — universe, analyzer and experiment. Each
  notebook ends in a Verify section that raises when a check fails.
- **Experiment 1's `BLUEPRINT_1.md`**, committed before the rule was coded, with its `JOURNAL_1.md`
  and `FINDINGS_1.md`.
- **`Paper_Trading_1`**, the book frozen on 2026-10-06. What it must show on paper, and when it is
  stopped, were registered in `Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` before its first day.

### Provenance

Golden Flow is the KaxaNuk Investment Lab's reference strategy, worked in a repository of its own.
The KaxaNuk Strategy Template was first extracted from its version 0.9.0. This copy is curated from
its version 0.15.1, and every figure is as that version recorded it. Two earlier versions of
Golden Flow tested the thirty most traded names of another index. They are not part of this
example, but the 23 and 14 books they priced count in Experiment 1's trial count of 107 books.
