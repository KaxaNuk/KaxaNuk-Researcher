# Setup

Everything needed to go from nothing to a repository you can work in. It is written so an agent —
Claude, Codex, Cursor — can follow it end to end, from `init-example` to an environment the worked
strategy runs in, and so a person can read it in a few minutes.

<!-- example: begin -->

> **On the example.** This folder is for reading. To run it, `init-example` copies it into a folder
> of its own — step 1 — and step 5 is skipped: this README is already the strategy's.
>
> **What a run needs.**
>
> - **An FMP key**, `KNDC_API_KEY_FMP`. FMP is this experiment's provider, and its symbols are the
>   seed's main identifier. A later experiment may use another provider, with the main identifier
>   KaxaNuk supplies for it.
> - **Three products of KaxaNuk's Analytics Factory**, below. No provider sells them.
>   `Data/hand_supplied.py` reads them under the Factory's own names, from where step 3 says.
> - **The Backtest Engine and Attribution Analysis licences.** Every performance and attribution
>   figure here came from Backtest Engine 0.66.0 and Attribution Analysis 0.2.0. Without them the
>   notebooks still write the portfolios, then report what is missing and skip.
> - **Portfolio Construction is not needed.** It is not installed:
>   `Experiments/portfolio_construction.py` sizes the book itself.
>
> | Product | File | What it holds |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | KN US Equity Core, holdings | `KN_US_Equity_Benchmark_Holdings.csv`, 46,388,746 bytes, md5 `eba4bf64ffa8de5d650e4e2c4b21844d` | the index's daily weights: `m_date` first, in ISO dates, then one column per listing keyed by the index's own ticker; about 600 members a day, 1,399 listings, 2000-01-03 to 2026-08-14 |
> | KN US Equity Core, returns | `KN_US_Equity_Benchmark_Returns.csv`, md5 `1668b564582f1871d7e4a6f39896e50a` | `m_date` written day first, then the index's daily return under the Factory's own header, `kn600` |
> | KN US Equity Factor Model | twenty files, about 1 GB | `Beta`, `Momentum`, `Residual_Volatility`, `Size`, `Value`, the eleven GICS sectors, `Market`, `Total_Factor_Returns`, `Total_Excess_Returns` and `Idyo_Returns`; the sector files hold no values, so sector attribution reads zero |
>
> Golden Flow's own run read these two index files, byte for byte, as
> `KN_US_Equity_Core_Holdings.csv` and `KN_US_Equity_Core_Returns.csv`; its journal uses those
> names. An older, smaller holdings file of the same name is the KN US Equity 600, another index:
> replace it. **Without the holdings, only the download runs**: every later stage reads membership
> from them.
>
> **The seed is committed.** `Universe/seed.py` rebuilds it only from the index's master of
> listings, a file of the Analytics Factory not in its published folders (ask `lab@kaxanuk.mx`).
> Running it overwrites the committed seed.
>
> **Times recorded on 2026-10-06.** The curator took 1 hour 37 minutes for 892 names, and 2 minutes
> for its second pass. The universe notebook took 17 seconds, once `seed.py` had filled the profile
> cache; a copy skips `seed.py`, so it first asks FMP for the profiles of the seed's 888 symbols.
> The refinery took 3 minutes. The analyzer's and the experiment's times were not recorded; the
> experiment prices 47 weight files in ten engine processes.

## What you need first

The two tools below, and an assistant — Claude or Codex — with the KaxaNuk Researcher installed
once for your user, as step 4 says. Python is **not** among them: `uv` fetches the right version
itself in step 2.

| Tool | Windows | macOS and Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [git](https://git-scm.com) | `winget install --id Git.Git -e` — or install GitHub Desktop, which brings it | `xcode-select --install` on macOS; your package manager on Linux |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 \| iex"` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

Open a **new** terminal after installing either, so it is on the path. `git --version` and
`uv --version` both answering is the whole check.

> **For the agent, before anything else.** Look at the folder you are in, and say what you found:
>
> - it holds `Bibliotheca/`, `Universe/` and `Experiments/` → the repository exists, go to step 2;
> - otherwise the repository does not exist yet → step 1. It needs **where to put it**, which
>   defaults to `golden-flow` beside the folder you are in; ask if the user has not said.
>
> Every command from step 2 on runs **in the root**, the folder step 1 made. Never a level above it.

---

## The rule: one folder is the whole project

One folder is the repository: open that folder, and run every command in it — nothing installed
a level above it, nothing nested a level below. What setup writes there, `.venv/` and
`Config/.env`, is ignored, as is anything an assistant or APM writes per machine (`.claude/`,
`.agents/`, `.codex/`, `apm_modules/`, `apm.lock.yaml`); `uv.lock`, which `uv sync` writes, is
committed.

---

## Step 1 — Get the repository

**`init-example` makes it** — a skill of the
[KaxaNuk Researcher](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher),
installed once for your user as step 4 says. It copies the worked example that ships in the
researcher package into a new folder, `golden-flow` unless you name another — by a script,
byte for byte — makes that folder a git repository, and commits it once. That folder is the root.
The example can be read
[on GitHub](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher/tree/main/examples/golden-flow)
without making anything.

**On Windows, keep the path short.** `D:\Research\...` is fine; a deep synced path such as
`C:\Users\<you>\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\...` is not. Tools that write deep inside the
folder, `uv sync` building `.venv/` among them, can pass Windows' 260-character path limit there
and fail with messages that do not say so, such as `WinError 3: The system cannot find the path
specified`.

A strategy of your own is not made from here: `init-strategy <strategy-name>` makes it from the
template, which already holds every file this example works through, as a description of what
belongs in it. Never build on it.

> **For the agent.** If the first commit refuses for want of an identity, ask the user, in plain
> words, for *a name and an e-mail to sign the versions saved here* — never invent them — and set
> them for this folder only: `git config user.name "<name>"` then `git config user.email "<email>"`.
> Then commit again: `git commit -m "Start from the KaxaNuk example strategy, golden-flow"`.

---

## Step 2 — Build the environment

From the root:

```bash
uv sync --group notebook --inexact
```

That creates `.venv/` and installs the pipeline, with the `notebook` group: JupyterLab and its
`nbconvert`, which runs a notebook, or strips its outputs, from the command line. **If neither
Python 3.12 nor 3.13 is on the machine, `uv` downloads 3.13** — there is nothing to install by hand.

**Why 3.13 and not the newest.** The Backtest Engine is documented for Python 3.12 or 3.13, and
every performance figure in this process comes from that engine, so the ceiling is its, not ours.
The Data Curator allows 3.12 to 3.14, which makes 3.13 the version that satisfies both.

**Once the Backtest Engine, Attribution Analysis or Portfolio Construction is installed by hand,
never run a bare `uv sync` here again:** it is exact, and removes every package `uv.lock` does not
name, which those three deliberately are not. Use the command above instead, `--inexact` included,
and `uv run` for everything else; both keep them. The `backtest-engine-runs`,
`attribution-analysis-runs` and `portfolio-construction-runs` skills have the installs.

**A newer Lab library** comes between experiments, never during one; your researcher says when one
is out: `uv lock --upgrade-package kaxanuk-data-curator`, then the command above — a licensed
library as its skill says. A book on paper stops on any Data Curator but the one it was frozen with.

---

## Step 3 — Put your keys in place

```bash
cp Config/.env.template Config/.env
```

Then open `Config/.env` with Notepad or TextEdit (in the macOS Finder, Cmd+Shift+. shows files
that start with a dot), paste each key after its `=`, and save.

Fill in the key for your data provider; the template has a line for FMP, Sharadar and LSEG.
`KNBE_API_KEY_KAXANUK` and `KNAA_API_KEY_KAXANUK` are the Backtest Engine and Attribution Analysis
licences: the process runs without them up to portfolio construction, and the backtest and
attribution report what is missing and skip. `KNPC_API_KEY_KAXANUK` is the Portfolio Construction
licence, since its 2.0.0 — the library reads it from the environment or a `.kaxanuk_license` file,
not from this file, as `portfolio-construction-runs` says: an equal-weight book needs neither the
key nor the library. A licence for any of the three, or access to Portfolio Construction, is
KaxaNuk's to give: write to `lab@kaxanuk.mx`, saying which library and what it is for —
<https://www.kaxanuk.mx/lab> shows the Lab.

`KN_ANALYTICS_PATH` is not a key: it is the folder in which KaxaNuk's Analytics Factory ships its
benchmark portfolios and factor models, which a strategy may read as its universe, its benchmark and
attribution's inputs (<https://www.kaxanuk.mx/analytics>; ask `lab@kaxanuk.mx` for them). It holds
`Benchmark Portfolios/` and `Factor Models/`, read in place in the Factory's own names and headers;
the older `Benchmarks/` and `Factors/` are still read where the new ones are absent. Leave it empty
and drop the same files, unchanged, into `Data/Curator/Benchmarks/` and `Data/Curator/Factors/`.

The four `PAPER_TRADING_*` lines configure step 7. Once a book is on paper,
`Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md` says how its daily run is scheduled.

<!-- example: begin -->

**In this example, `Paper_Trading_1` is Experiment 1's book**, frozen on 2026-10-06 and kept as a
record. It does not run from this copy, for the reasons
[`Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md`](Paper_Trading/BITACORA.md) gives.

<!-- example: end -->

> **For the agent.** Never open, read back, print or echo `Config/.env`, and never put a value from
> it in a command that gets recorded. You may say **which keys are still empty, by name only**,
> with the one check allowed, which prints names and never values — Git Bash, then PowerShell:
>
> ```
> grep -E '^[A-Z_]+=$' Config/.env | cut -d= -f1
> Select-String -Pattern '^[A-Z_]+=$' Config/.env | ForEach-Object { $_.Line.TrimEnd('=') }
> ```
>
> You cannot fill them: that is the one thing in this file only the user can do.

---

## Step 4 — The agent skills are installed once, for your user

**Nothing to install here.** KaxaNuk's agent skills — how each Lab library is called, how an
experiment is structured, how attribution is read, the house rules — and the
[KaxaNuk Researcher](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher)'s own
are installed once for your user, not per repository, by the same command that gave you step 1:

```bash
uvx --from apm-cli==0.33.0 apm install -g KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher --target claude
```

`--target codex`, `cursor` or another assistant in place of `claude`; the researcher package's
[`SETUP.md`](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher/blob/main/SETUP.md) says what each
receives.

They are then available in every folder, this one included, and
`uvx --from apm-cli==0.33.0 apm update -g` keeps every strategy current at once. **A strategy
installs nothing.** Your researcher's home, made once with `init-researcher`, can be invited into
this folder for its library — `claude --add-dir <the researcher's folder>`, `/add-dir` once
inside, or the desktop app's add-folder button; for its identity to load with it, follow *In a
strategy or another project* in the researcher's own README.

**Nothing in the pipeline imports a skill either.** The repository runs, the notebooks run and the
results are the same with or without them.

> **For the agent.** Do not install skills into this repository. If they are missing, give the user
> the command above, with the assistant you are as the target — it installs for their user, not
> here — and say that they appear in a **new** session.

---

## Step 5 — Make the README the strategy's

The `README.md` that `init-strategy` copied describes the KaxaNuk Strategy Template, not your
strategy. A strategy repository's README describes **the strategy**: what it is, what it claims,
where it stands. Replace the whole file with this, filled in, and leave the process to the link:

```markdown
# <strategy-name>

<one sentence on the idea — or: The objective is not written yet; see OBJECTIVE.md.>

> **Status: set up, nothing measured.** Replace this line as the strategy moves, and the banner at
> the top of `AGENTS.md` with it.

Built on the [KaxaNuk Strategy Template](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher/blob/main/templates/strategy/README.md):
eight steps as a folder structure. Its README says what each folder is for, where each
kind of logic goes and, under *Starting your own strategy*, the order to work in; this one does not
repeat it. **Next:** [`OBJECTIVE.md`](OBJECTIVE.md), the idea and its claims, before any paper is
read.

| Read | For |
| --- | --- |
| [`OBJECTIVE.md`](OBJECTIVE.md) | the idea, and the status of each claim inside it |
| [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) | every number this repository has measured, and what it cost |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | how work is done here, and the bar a result has to clear |
| [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) | how this repository is set up on a new machine |
```

Put the same status line in place of the banner at the top of `AGENTS.md`. In `pyproject.toml`,
rename `name` to the strategy's and set `version` to `0.1.0`. `LICENSE` names KaxaNuk as the
holder — put yourself there, or choose another licence. In `CHANGELOG.md`, keep everything above
the first `---` line and replace the template's entries below it with the strategy's first,
naming the template version `pyproject.toml` declared before you reset it:

```markdown
## 0.1.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)

**MINOR** — started from the KaxaNuk Strategy Template <template-version>. Nothing measured yet.
```

Then run `uv lock`, so `uv.lock` records the new name and version, and commit them together with
`uv.lock`, the other file the setup itself produced:

```bash
git add README.md AGENTS.md pyproject.toml LICENSE CHANGELOG.md uv.lock
git commit -m "README: <strategy-name>"
```

> **For the agent.** The name is the one you asked for at the start; the sentence too, if the user
> gave one — **never invent a thesis**, use the placeholder. The holder in `LICENSE` is the user's
> name: ask if you do not have it, never invent it. Everything else in the block is fixed. Do not
> keep the template's README under another name: the process lives upstream, and a copy here is a
> copy that drifts.

---

## What "done" looks like

From the root:

```bash
git status
```

**It should be clean.** Step 5 committed what the setup itself changed: the README, the `AGENTS.md`
banner, `pyproject.toml`'s name and version, the licence holder, the first `CHANGELOG.md` entry,
and `uv.lock` — which pins the versions this strategy's results will come from, and is why the
template ships without one and your repository keeps one.
Everything else the commands produced — `.venv/`, `Config/.env`, and whatever your assistant
writes per machine, such as `.claude/` — is ignored.
**Anything showing up means something was written in the wrong place.**

<!-- example: begin -->

**In this example, `uv.lock` shows up untracked,** and nothing is wrong: the example commits none,
so its library versions resolve when `uv sync` runs.

<!-- example: end -->

Then open **this folder** — not a parent of it — in your editor, PyCharm or VS Code, and in your
assistant, Claude or Codex.

**In a new strategy nothing runs yet, on purpose:** every `.py` file and notebook says what belongs
in it. Your assistant writes each one with you, in the order of parts A to H of the template's
README, and can read the worked example's copy of the same file beside yours (`init-example`, into
a folder of its own). The first code that runs is `Data/curator.py`, once `OBJECTIVE.md` and the
seed exist.

> **For the agent — the hand-over.** Say the absolute path of the root, that it is the whole project
> and the folder to open, that the README is now the strategy's, which `.env` keys are still empty
> by name, that the skills are installed once for the user and nothing is installed here, and that
> the next step is `objective`, which drafts `OBJECTIVE.md` with them; `next` says what comes after.
> Then stop. Starting research work is a different request.

<!-- example: begin -->

**In this example, the hand-over says the folder is the worked example, for reading;** the next
thing is its README's *How to read it*, or *Run it* once the keys and files are in place; a
strategy of your own is `init-strategy <name>`.

<!-- example: end -->

---

## Next

The first thing to write is `OBJECTIVE.md`: the idea and its claims, before any paper is read. The
order after it is *Starting your own strategy* in the
[template's README](https://github.com/KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher/blob/main/templates/strategy/README.md),
which also says where each kind of logic goes; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) says how work is done
here.

<!-- example: begin -->

**In this example nothing is written:** read `OBJECTIVE.md`, then `RESULTS.md`.

<!-- example: end -->
