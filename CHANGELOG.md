# Changelog

Every notable change to this repository, newest first: `## X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` with
`### Added / Changed / Removed`, and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This is the researcher *skeleton*; a person's own library is their clone and is not versioned here.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-05)

**MINOR** — the first researcher skeleton.

**What to do differently:** clone it under the name you give your researcher, open the folder in
Claude Code, run `/researcher-init`.

### Added

* The library architecture — `Sources/` read-only, `Library/` compiled with one `INDEX.md` and an
  append-only `LOG.md`, `Notes/` cited never compiled, `Notes/Private/` never read unasked,
  `Output/` written only when asked — adapted from the MIT-licensed obsidian-vault-kit, with
  standard markdown links instead of wikilinks and no dependency on any viewer.
* `RESEARCHER.md`, the personality file the `/researcher-init` interview writes: name, owner,
  domains, voice, beliefs, non-negotiables, tag policy, the strategies it works on.
* `AGENTS.md`, the operating rules, and `CLAUDE.md` pointing at both.
* Eleven commands: `researcher-init`, `compile`, `query`, `teach`, `audit`, `refine`,
  `refresh-index`, and the four that connect the researcher to a strategy built from the KN
  Research Process template — `note`, `objective`, `blueprint`, `brainstorm`.
* The `library-query` skill, which answers questions about what the library says from the index
  and the links, citing every claim.
* `apm.yml` declaring KaxaNuk's core knowledge — the `common`, `data-curator` and `investment-lab`
  packages from `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-APM` — so `apm install` teaches the researcher the process and the
  Lab modules.
