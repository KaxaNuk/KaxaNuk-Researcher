## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-21
The KaxaNuk Researcher is one repository and one package: its skills and commands, the three commands that make every folder, and the strategy template, its worked example and the researcher's home they copy. Versions up to 0.5.6 are in `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher-Template`'s `CHANGELOG.md`; the strategy template's history is in `templates/strategy/CHANGELOG.md`.
### Added
- **`init-researcher`, `init-strategy` and `init-example`**, skills the owner runs by name. Each copies a starting point into a new folder with `init-strategy`'s `scripts/scaffold.py` — byte for byte, never from memory — after a plan and the owner's go, and makes it a git repository with its first commit. `init-example <path>` copies one file or folder of the worked example into an existing strategy: a file already there with the same content is skipped, and one with other content stops the copy. The script finds the package beside itself, under `apm_modules/`, or under `~/.apm/` where `apm install -g` puts it, and has unit tests.
- **`templates/strategy/`**, the KaxaNuk Strategy Template at 0.8.0, from `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Strategy-Template`'s `main`; **`examples/liquid-golden-cross/`**, its worked example at 0.8.0, from that repository's `example` branch; **`templates/researcher/`**, the researcher's home at 0.6.0, from `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher-Template`. All three are ordinary folders, and the template and the example no longer live on two branches kept in step by hand — 0.7.14 reached one and not the other. A strategy's `Bibliotheca/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` and `LOG.md` ship empty in the template.
### Changed
- **The researcher is a package installed once for the user.** `read`, `query` and the ten commands were copied into every home, so each home carried code it could not safely edit and every version arrived by a git merge. Now `apm install -g KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher` puts every KaxaNuk skill — this package's and, through its dependency on `KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Agent-Skills/kaxanuk`, every Investment Lab package's — in every folder the owner opens; `apm update -g` brings each new version everywhere; and a strategy installs nothing.
- **`scripts/extract.py` and `references/note.md` live in the `read` skill's folder,** and the skills name them by *this skill's directory*.
- **Files a strategy lacks come from the package.** `read` copies the empty bibliography and log from the template with `scaffold.py --only`; `blueprint` and `brainstorm` give `init-example Experiments/Experiment_1/...` instead of fetching a branch of the template's repository.
- **`update`** runs `apm update -g`, and compares the home's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `.gitignore` with `templates/researcher/`, showing what changed rather than merging. For a home from before this release it is the migration: it removes the home's copies of the skills, commands, script and reference, empties `apm.yml`'s dependencies, and installs the package for the user, keeping the agent and any skill the owner wrote.
- **`researcher-init`** checks for the skills at user scope; **`audit`** compares installed copies under `~/.claude/` with the packages under `~/.apm/apm_modules/`.
### What to do differently
- **Install once:** `uv tool install apm-cli`, then `apm install -g KaxaNuk/KaxaNuk-Researcher --target <your agent>`.
- **A home from before this release runs `update` once.** Until then it keeps working on the copies it has.
- **A new strategy is `init-strategy <name>`**, not *Use this template*; the example is `init-example`.
