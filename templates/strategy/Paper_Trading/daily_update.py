The daily run over every graduated book -- step 7 of the KaxaNuk Strategy Template.

In plain words: once a day, after the market closes, refresh the data, run each frozen strategy
exactly as it was when it graduated, price it with the engine, and write down what happened --
how the book is doing over its whole history and since the day it was frozen, and anything that
does not look like the backtest said it would.

A graduated book is a frozen copy of the strategy, made once by `promote.py`: the files it needs,
copied byte for byte into `Paper_Trading_N/` in the strategy's own layout, with `FREEZE.json`
naming the commit, the date and the hash of each.  Every path in those copies resolves inside the
book's folder, so an experiment under construction can change the shared modules and the graduated
book never moves.  **A paper-trading run re-fits nothing**: a run that tunes anything is a
backtest wearing a costume, and it answers a question nobody asked.

What one run does, in order:

1. Takes a lock, so two runs never overlap, and writes its log to `Paper_Trading/Logs/`.
2. Refreshes the shared raw data once -- `Data/curator.py` with the day as its end date -- or,
   with `PAPER_TRADING_INPUT=database`, reads the panel another machine published.
3. Checks the newest day before any book reads it: a close with no fill price, a move no price can
   make, a cash or benchmark file behind the day, an index file behind it.  A check that fails
   stops every book before anything is written: a book on broken data is worse than none.
4. For each book in `BOOKS`: compares the Curator's calculations with the ones frozen, links the
   raw files into the book's folder, and calls `paper_trading_N.run(as_of)`, which runs the frozen
   refinery and rule and prices the book and its control twice -- over the whole history and
   since the freeze.
5. Writes the record through `record.py`: the book in force, the engine's daily values and
   statistics, the diagnostics, and a flag for each diagnostic outside the band the book's
   section of `BITACORA.md` registered before its first day, each failed check and each
   restatement.
6. Exits 0 when clean, 1 when a flag was raised, 2 when a step failed, so a scheduler can tell.

Configured in `Config/.env`: `PAPER_TRADING_INPUT` (`provider` or `database`),
`PAPER_TRADING_SINKS` (`local`, `database` or both), `PAPER_TRADING_DATABASE` and
`PAPER_TRADING_PUBLISH_DATA`; each has a flag that overrides it for one run.  `SETUP.md` says how
to schedule it.

Every performance figure it writes comes from the engine.  See `BITACORA.md` for the gate a book
passes to get here.
