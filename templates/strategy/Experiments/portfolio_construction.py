Portfolio construction -- step 4 of 8, the second shared module.  Turns the set of securities a
rule calls eligible into the weights a book holds, calling the KaxaNuk Portfolio Construction
library where it is installed.

In plain words: how much of what, and how often you change your mind.

Runs inside an experiment notebook, from the rule in section 2, on the matrices the securities
panel built.

What is expected here is one function signature and a few things behind it:

- The signature.  Given the securities eligible today and a returns history that has already been
  cut off before today, return one weight per security, summing to at most 1.0.  Every weighting
  scheme -- equal weight, or any sizing method the library registers whose configuration has no
  required field: inverse volatility, risk parity, hierarchical risk parity -- is the same shape,
  so swapping one for another is one line in the rule cell and nothing else in the notebook moves.
  That is what makes two experiments comparable rather than merely adjacent.
- The library inside the signature, never around it.  Build one of its methods per rebalance date,
  on the history already cut: a method that estimates from returns uses whatever history it was
  built with, and the library's own pipeline builds each method once for every date.  Import it
  inside a guard -- it is KaxaNuk's own library, installed by hand -- and stop with an error that
  names a method needing it when it is absent.  Equal weight needs nothing.
- At most one, not exactly one.  A strategy that can go to cash cannot satisfy the stricter form;
  the residual becomes a real, priced cash position when the weight file is written.
- The constraints every scheme respects, as arguments of `build_weights`: a maximum weight and a
  minimum holding count.  Each is a lever a later experiment has to earn by beating the book
  without it.
- The two timing helpers that cannot be forgotten if they live here: lag the eligibility so the
  set used on rebalance date t is the one observed at t-1, and rebalance only on the dates that set
  changes -- a signal that has not moved is not a reason to pay commission.
- Causality by construction.  A weigher never sees a date, only a history already cut off, so it
  cannot reach into the future even by accident.

It produces the `REBALANCE_DATES x securities` target weights the rule cell hands to the
diagnostics and the weight file.

It prevents a good signal in a portfolio nobody could hold -- and a weighting difference that reads
as a signal difference because each notebook invented its own sizing.
