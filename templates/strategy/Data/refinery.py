Data Refinery -- step 3 of 8, block 2 of 3.  The cross-sectional layer over the curated data.

In plain words: the Curator sees one security at a time; this stage sees all of them on one date.
It stacks every Curator file into one panel, computes the `r_*` columns across it, and writes the
files back out with more columns, each security's rows kept inside the span the seed gives it.

Runs after `Universe/universe.ipynb`, because it joins the security master that notebook writes,
and before `Data/analyzer.ipynb`, which reads what this writes.  Run too early it should say which
columns it is skipping and carry on -- the right behaviour and the wrong outcome.

    Data/Curator/Time_Series/<id>.csv      m_* + c_*                    per security
            |
            v   stack, compute per date across the cross-section, join the master
    Data/Refinery/Time_Series/<id>.csv     m_* + c_* + r_* + current_*  rows in span, more columns

What is expected here is loading, ordering and writing.  The calculations live in
`Data/Refinery/custom_calculations.py`.

- Membership is an allowlist taken from `Universe/Investable_Universe.csv`, so the cash proxy and
  the benchmarks in the Curator folder never enter a rank.  There is no second list to forget.
- Keep each security's rows inside the span the seed gives it: outside it, a file under a reused
  identifier is another company's history, and no stage may read it.  A seed without spans keeps
  every row.
- Resolve each `r_*` function by its parameter names against the columns already built -- the same
  convention the Curator uses -- and compute them in dependency order.
- Join the classification columns of `Universe/Security_Master.csv`, prefixed `current_`, because
  they are what a security is classified as today, not on the date of the row.  Skip them, and say
  so, when the master does not exist yet.
- Report per-column coverage on every run, so an all-null column cannot slip past.
- Delete refined files for securities no longer in the seed.  A stale file carries ranks taken
  against a universe that no longer exists, and anything reading the folder would average two
  incompatible cross-sections without raising an error.

This is the seam the KaxaNuk Data Refinery library replaces.  Keep the contract -- Curator files
in, `r_*` functions resolved by name, Refinery files out with each security's rows inside its
span -- and the swap is a one-file change.

It produces `Data/Refinery/Time_Series/`, the panel every experiment reads.

It prevents a rank or a breadth reading that was quietly taken over the wrong set of securities.
